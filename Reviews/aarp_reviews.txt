[<p><p>All of a sudden they raised ** to tier 3. It's tier 2 everywhere else. Had to pay over $70. Before it was around $7. Was prescribed ** for pain from pinched nerve. They didn't cover it at all.

[<p><p>I called the AARP Rx plan for a renewal on a generic Rx and I was told it was not covered but I could pay the deductible of $400 and then I would be responsible for 30%. They now classed it as a Tier 4. Previously, I paid $28. For the same Rx. Also, I was on the phone with a representative who spoke very poor English, she spoke very quickly, put me on hold 3 times, then transferred me to the wrong department and they hung up on me. No resolution and I am in an emergency situation. Horrible customer service!</p></p>, <p>I called the AARP Rx plan for a renewal on a generic Rx and I was told it was not covered but I could pay the deductible of $400 and then I would be responsible for 30%.

[<p><p>I have been a Pharmacist for over 52 years and have never witnessed a bigger ripoff than United Health Care Part D has provided to the consuming public. AARP does not care since they get a big payback off the backs of the vulnerable. To make matters worse Medicare Fraud Waste and Abuse pays little attention to complaints and sends you back to United Health Care. Their mail is always full. I could write paragraphs in detail but I will provide the best advise I can give: Use GoodRx to find the best price and pay cash. It will benefit you in most cases. The formula that United Health uses only pay for the cheapest of drugs and they can be obtained almost anywhere for less money. Only the very lucky get prior approval on more expensive drugs and only if United gets kick back from drug companies. A truly ugly situation all around.</p></p>, <p>I have been a Pharmacist for over 52 years and have never witnessed a bigger ripoff than United Health Care Part D has provided to the consuming public.

[<p><p>As a disabled individual, I have had Medicare Part A and B alongside Medicaid most of my life. In 2013 I was automatically enrolled into a Medicare RX Plan through AARP that was paid for by Medicare. Apparently, in 2018 the cost of the program increased to $4.10 above what Medicare was willing to pay for. The problem is, no one ever told me this in advance nor was I ever given an option to refuse. I am told a letter was sent to inform me, but even if that is true, as I understand "slamming" is an illegal practice where a policy change is made without explicit permission. Sending a letter, and then changing it because I did not receive or respond to a letter, is wrong.</p></p>, <p>As a disabled individual, I have had Medicare Part A and B alongside Medicaid most of my life.

Sending a letter, and then changing it because I did not receive or respond to a letter, is wrong.</p>, <p>Then, on June 17th 2019 I received a bill with a due date of July 1st for $58.80. After an hour on the phone, I learned of the above facts of the case, but they were neither willing to waive this bill nor assure me that they would wait for my permission in the future. Worse, for the entire life of the account they were paid thousands of dollars on my behalf for the policy but only paid around $40 meaning they asked for me to pay more than what I would otherwise have to pay for out of pocket while having received thousands of dollars, and even then they had zero interest in working with me to retain me as a customer.</p>, <p>While the agent I spoke with wasn't rude, and appeared to do as much as she could, I found the situation unacceptable. My disability is severely affected by stress and the possibility of having this happen again was too dangerous to my health to allow, so I cancelled my policy immediately. Even though it would not have hurt me to keep it until the end of this year, I find their business practice to be untrustworthy. I paid the amount they billed me for, but not because I agree with the bill or even because I could afford it. Rather, it is because of the fear of damage to my credit report. I do not believe I should have had to pay this as I never agreed to the amount prior to billing.</p>]
[<p><p>The several times I've been on the phone totaled to 7 hours... First, they told me because I moved, I was not covered in another state. I call and changed the address before I left. Then I was told I need to reinstate. When I thought I've already done it I was told everything should be as usual other than the change of address... Then they called me up saying I owe money from Feb of 2017 a year??? That is a year and a half ago. How do they come up with that when I have everything on auto pay. They have no explanation as to how hey came up with that amount. Well!!! I paid it because it was less than $90 and I did not want to be on the phone again... After 2 weeks, they send me a bill saying I owed money again??? I am on auto pay!!! This is a bad joke or something. Who do they hire to work in the billing dept??? Up to now, there is no answers... And the phone center is in the Philippines or somewhere in the Far East.</p></p>, <p>The several times I've been on the phone totaled to 7 hours...

[<p><p>I have been trying to get my Medicare-United Healthcare Part D prescriptions sent to me since June. United Healthcare farms this service out to Optum Mail Orders.

[<p><p>So far, these past several months, I have been unable to fill prescriptions that I need to take because everything seems to be non covered by United Health Care, or it is a tier 4 and costs me $400+ for 30 day supply. The company does not seem to be based in America anymore, has no English speaking reps when I call on the telephone. To make matters worse, the premium for this plan has skyrocketed this year. I used to pay $39 per month but this year the cost has jumped to $72.60 per month. I am a retired senior citizen, on Medicare and a small pension (but not small enough to qualify for any financial aid). This company has to be driven out of healthcare business. They are shamefully ** their customers.</p></p>, <p>So far, these past several months, I have been unable to fill prescriptions that I need to take because everything seems to be non covered by United Health Care, or it is a tier 4 and costs me $400+ for 30 day supply.

[<p><p>AARP United Healthcare Rx Plan: This is truly the worst plan I have ever had. most of my med are no longer covered. Also why is it that I paid in American money, but I get someone in India? I have to call 3 to 4x a week just to keep asking for info that have not been sent. Then after I called and tried to talk to "the help" and told her 3x not, NOT to send or change my for an order that cost me $175.00 plus bank fees. This is the type of company that should be closed. It's hard enough to be on SSDI let alone have to fight for meds because no one listens to you (will maybe if they spoke English). I have filed a complaint once already and will be once again. Saying you have sub-par service would to say you have some kind of service.

[<p><p>AARP United Medical Part D. I just turned 65 and was very afraid of Medicare. As I had to sign up, I listed all my medications and three of them that were on the list and approved were denied after I took the time to go to the Dr and obtain my legally written prescriptions. I have to say these were not narcotics, just medications to cure pain I had. So it seems we get screwed again, income tax, now insurance. Those holding office should subscribe to Medicare for 6 months to see if they don' blow a gasket and get lost in the red tape.</p></p>, <p>AARP United Medical Part D.

[<p><p>I have had a Medicare Part D plan with AARP / United Healthcare / OptumRx for one month now. It is by far the worst prescription drug coverage I have ever had. I have had a chronic illness for 20 years and have a lot of experience with insurance companies. OptumRx is refusing to cover treatment I have received for 20 years even though it is in their formulary. They have refused another Rx after appeal as well.

[<p><p>Recently I ordered ** from my AARP Medicare RX Plan which is a PDP plan. When I received my order I found that they had substituted a generic drug called ** without informing me or my doctor.

On 1/1/2015, the plan monthly payment increased to $53.90 per month -- an increase of 13%. On 1/1/16, the plan increased to $58.80, which was an increase of 9%. I just went to pay my premium for January 2017, and the plan price increased by close to 25%!!! I am now obliged to pay $72.70.per month! In order to "do the math" I would have to spend HUGE amounts of time, but my best guess is that the AARP United Plan is a huge rip-off.</p>, <p>I need a ** prescription for a cough medicine for a persistent upper respiratory infection for which United pays virtually nothing. I've simply stopped getting the prescription as I can't afford it -- I hack and cough as I know it will not be covered. My physician has prescribed a non-generic medication. In order for him to prescribe a generic medication, It would take oodles of paper work. I go to a low-cost clinic which takes Medicare, and I imagine the paperwork would take several months.</p>, <p>IF -- big IF -- I had the time to "do the math" my best guess is that I would find that UNITED AARP Preferred Prescription Plan is making money off of me -- based on what I would pay for prescriptions WITHOUT the coverage: a near 25% increase in ONE year!!! They justify this by saying that: if you go to another plan you will have a big deductible to pay so this is still the "best plan." My bet is that there is "pay to play" involved here. Big pharmacies tell their customers that AARP United is the "best" plan out there. Far from the truth...Money involved??? I think of the title of a Tommy Lee Jones movie: "No Country for Old People." We're living it...</p>]

[<p><p>I started with the AARP Pharmacy plan and after 2 years I came to the conclusion there were better plans and at less money. First I called them to tell them I would not be renewing my plan however they kept billing me for payments. I hadn't used the RX program in probably over a year and by not paying their monthly fee there should have not been any RX service. I figured wrong as they now have a collection agency after me for payment of something I never wanted or used. My credit is excellent as I always pay on time or upfront but AARP Pharmacy does not care about their customer. You are a Medicare number and their major concern is about those premiums coming in every month. If you do decide to go with them, you will get a taste of their care for you when dealing with their service department.</p></p>, <p>I started with the AARP Pharmacy plan and after 2 years I came to the conclusion there were better plans and at less money. First I called them to tell them I would not be renewing my plan however they kept billing me for payments. I hadn't used the RX program in probably over a year and by not paying their monthly fee there should have not been any RX service. I figured wrong as they now have a collection agency after me for payment of something I never wanted or used.

I was told by a legislative aid for the bill that they did not know what was in it with no cause of action or directions. I was told I had to find a Part D insurer or pay a life time of penalty fees. </p>, <p>Six months later and a hospitalization, [I had to pay for], I ended up stuck on Medicare part D. I was given 10 days and ended up in hospital before I could sort through the two foot high pages of brochures to supposedly compare and contrast apples and oranges. I would say that 90% error rate of some kind or another has accrued with my AARP Prescription Solutions' orders has occurred, that includes sending medicines I did not order and not taking them back, sending overnight [I paid], that were ordered snail mail and vice versa on the others, that must have for many critical illness including a terminal illness diagnosis. It took repeated phone calls trying to get the other overnight due to their error with out success. </p>, <p>Usually, their errors are never corrected or at best one goes through their malfunctioning phone and computer systems [they usually always come to claiming the computers are down or being reconfigured] that do things like switch you to customer satisfaction surveys when you said you did not want to take one and even before you have talked to anyone to evaluate if you had agreed. Then, the inevitable holds while your cell phone bill adds up over time charges. The disconnections and yes even purposeful hang ups are massive. They clearly have no ability to pass information on or fail to do so nor provide remedial training that can ever experience be seen by me. </p>, <p>This is evidenced by glitches that even the customers can figure out, articulate and offer systemic improvement for between the order, the pharmacy and the mail room. Medicines will sit in the pharmacy because just one of numerous is out or needs more work and you are waiting overnight of course. They hold them all up till they solve the one in question to send on later. I have been willing to pay the overnight as it gives them less time to mess up orders in their hands. The instructions from order to pharmacy does not get passed on the the mail room. They will send all medicines that orders exist for verse the clear directions to send the ones only given that you need.</p>, <p>Complaints are useless to either AARP, them or the specialty pharmacies they phone some out to. I have shown many friends have them watch the getting sent in circles that never lead to anywhere. I had a doctor friend try to unravel the lack of clarity, getting sent in circles, getting a medication ordered an clarification of whom owns whom of which company and a chain of subsidiaries... subs of sub inities. Four hours later, he saw it was not my error or problem solving but a nightmare that could not be resolved or even averted. The companies of the companies don't even know whom each other are nor any central place to unravel or even give a valid phone number to the correct place [they even admit it on the phone]. The appeal rules go on for ever. They can string out for up to a year if time lines are followed and the sick patient or worse, confused elderly has no chance against the insanity. </p>, <p>Think of the money involved with millions of customers handed to them by AARP who does not step in and stop the madness regardless to people trusting the past reputation to make the insurance choice they did. Since they have been on the take verses advocating all respect and trust in them will soon be completely gone. They should just become a drug company and join big Pharmacy in milking America. It seems clear with the volume of unsuccessful services that so many have died or been injured and it seems there will be no stopping them till the class action and individual law suits shut them down.</p>, <p>Unregulated part D was a nightmare and suspicion should have raised a red flag when Republican spent the night twisting arms to pass it. Tonight, I set without medicines for three weeks although some did come overnight 8 days after promised [they did not even contact my doctor for seven days not the next day as promised on a second conversation with two previous hours spent being told that was not the process when it is.] Why only some and why the randomness of whom choose the ones that did showed up for eight days, not the next and why I got a phone call eight days later asking for a second approval for payment as the first authorization was not enough. Then them being dishonest of the week, it took to send the medicines list to the doctor for re-authorization and then being hung up on for explaining. </p>, <p>How crazy the latest in chronic dysfunctional services is experienced and what the consequences are and could turn into [insulin being one of the medications not sent. I will start the phone calls all over again three weeks into being out of most medicines and be put on extended holds, repetition of information numerous times, deal with a broken phone system that voice recognition does not work on while you repeatedly say answers, then key in then manual input repeating all to a real person who knows how many, the same information.Each three months when it is time to deal with them I go into panic attaches because I know it will never correct itself from there end and will just have to suffer the craziness.</p>]

They do bear a date and a number, but the tiny print says "reply by" next to the date, and "authorization code" next to the number. No where on the mailing does the actual expiration date or the member's real membership number appear.</p>, <p>Result? If you are not sure if you have paid up or not, you can't tell from the notice. There's not even the standard polite disclaimer: "if you have recently renewed, thank you and please ignore this request. "</p>, <p>If you pay up, do the mailings stop for a year? No, another month later, another identical mailing arrives with cards attached, new date, new authorization code.</p>, <p>We called earlier this year to complain to AARP, but the mailings have continued even though we are renewed. We now have fourteen cards from this year and last, four duplicates for myself, one for my husband, the rest are apparently junk but they look like valid cards and came with requests for more money. If nothing else, this is a colossal waste of resources and money.

After 4 to 5 years of struggling to control my multiple diseases and their symptoms, I have just started to do well using my current medications. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2001 and have been on SSDI since 2005. Because we moved to South Dakota, I got a letter from my prior Part D carrier (Aetna) that said that I had to change my Medicare Part D insurance carrier.</p>, <p>I chose AARP United Healthcare Part D thinking that AARP provided oversight for the quality of the products they endorse. My coverage started on August 1st of this year. There have been no changes in my diagnosis or the kind or amount of the medications that I need to prevent the progression of my MS, treat my immune deficiency, control my asthma, or prevent my alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency from causing liver and lung disease. In 2004 I was required to submit a complete package of medical records and was subjected to an SSDI evaluation that included a review of all of my medical records and a face to face assessment. </p>, <p>I have been using ** for over 8 years. In 2001, I was prescribed **. My physicians (8 MDs) and I submitted detailed records of the evolution of my disease processes, the results of extensive medical test and MRI results to people who are not qualified to make a decision about the complex nature of these diseases and the unique synergistic effects that threaten to accelerate the progression of my MS.</p>, <p>Fortunately, the Social Security Administration and my previous insurance companies agreed with my physicians' findings and treatment recommendations. In August and September, I had several of my less expensive medications refilled at Walgreens Pharmacy under my new AARP United Healthcare Part D insurance policy. It was not until I attempted to refill my prescription for my ** through Prescription Solutions that I began to run afoul of AARP United Healthcare Rx. Aetna's specialty pharmacy had been sending my ** to me every three months. My next refill was due in October.</p>, <p>In late September, I called AARP United Healthcare's Prescription Solutions (specialty pharmacy) to arrange for a refill of my **. I have had several conversations with the Prescription Solutions staff over the past three weeks. To date they have not shipped the ** that I need to keep my MS from progressing. On Saturday, October 23rd at 7:15 am, I received a prerecorded message from AARP United Healthcare, Prescription Solutions that said that the pre-authorization for my medication, **, was denied. I need ** to prevent my multiple sclerosis from progressing and crippling me more than I already am. Later that same day, I received a letter from AARP Medicare Rx Plans that informed me that you will not fill another of my medications. The letter states that the drug they are refusing to refill is either not included on our covered drug list or is subject to certain limits.</p>, <p>This particular medication is one of a limited number of alternatives available to me. Because of my alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, I cannot take any medications that will damage my liver. In addition, I have to inject medications 13 times a week and I do not want to have to inject another medication when a transdermal delivery system works well for me. I have worked since the age of 12 (swept parking lots and cleaned bathrooms). After I graduated from CSU Sonoma and UC Davis, I worked in professional positions until I was forced to retire in 2003. I often worked more that one job and had to pay insurance premiums at each for over 35 years. </p>, <p>I do not know what the total of the premiums I paid to the insurance companies were but the money that went to the insurance companies benefited them many times over when they invested that money. Throughout my life. I lived responsibly. I gave all I had to my family, community and country. You have no right to withhold my medications from me.</p>, <p>On the same day (Saturday October 23rd ) I received the United Healthcare 2011 Annual Notice of Changes that lets me know that I can change my coverage between November 15 and December 31st. I also want to note in this letter that, although AARP United Healthcare  Rx Plans have been authorized to provide coverage to residents of South Dakota, AARP United Healthcare's administrative offices are located in Hot Springs, AR. In addition, the letter I received says that I have to file a grievance with an entity in Cypress, CA and that my physician should send his request for an exception to Costa Mesa, CA.</p>, <p>In addition, the email function on the AARP United Healthcare site does not provide the United Healthcare email address and other functions have been disabled. I want the staff at AARP United Healthcare to be aware of the problems they create for those of us who need the care and medications to prevent, treat, or control the devastating diseases that can have a catastrophic impact on our health, our lives, and the lives of our friends and families by using these tactics. Before I was diagnosed with MS, I worked at the California Department of Health Services as a Consultant and, during my employment there, was involved in fraud prevention and fraud investigation. We called the strategies you are using both artificial barriers and soft barriers.</p>, <p>Before HIPPA these and other more cruel strategies and devices used to prevent people from accessing the care and resources that they needed when they got sick. From what I have observed this past three weeks, it does not look like much has changed. I will not tolerate an increase in my premium or co-pay to offset any perceived compromise on your part. If you continue down this path, I will be forced to seek the services of an attorney. I will be documenting every interaction I have with AARP United Healthcare Rx. Using plausible deniability in my case will not be a viable defense for you. If my MS progresses in any way, may God help both of us. Sincerely.</p>]
[<p>I can no longer afford to pay for my prescription policy with AARP MedicareRX Preferred. I could not find any way to unenroll online, so, I called the Customer Care number above and was told that I would have to send my cancellation request in a fax.  This seems absurd as I was able to enroll online without a problem.  I also have done business with many other companies online and have never had a problem canceling a service on other company websites. AARP MedicareRX gave me two fax numbers, either of which I could use to send my cancellation request. Since I do not have a fax machine, I had to walk a couple of blocks to the nearest mailbox store in order to fax it.  The first fax number was a number that was disconnected or no longer in use, according to a recording.  The second number was continually busy. I waited at the mailbox store for over a half hour trying to re-fax the cancellation request. Other people were needing to fax things, so, I had to leave without connecting and sending my cancellation request. I think this is the way AARP MedicareRX Preferred keeps their customers, at least for a while longer, by making it as difficult and inconvenient as possible to unenroll.  This is causing me a hardship, and, if my bank account is debited for next month's premium payment,due to my not being able to cancel,  I will be overdrawn in my bank account. Now, it is raining, but, I will have to walk to the mailbox store again to attempt to fax the cancellation request again.  Now, I am more determined than ever that I will not do any repeat business with a company who provides this kind of customer service.  I doubt this will matter to them- who cares about providing good customer service to people who are unenrolling?</p>]

[<p>AARP was taking my premium for my RX plan out of my social security check, while I was paying it also by check.  This had been cancelled and many calls to correct this have resulted in NO response since 12/7/08-1/13/09.  They have kept the money from both payments without the courtesy of ANY response.  Requests for supervisor response have also resulted in no response.  I should have my money back, plus interest, since no one cares to help.

                            I have spent extensive amounts of time on this - a number of AARP CSRs, UnitedHealth Group CSRs, and ExpressScripts CSRs have told me that this has been a big problem - that seniors did not realize that their mail order pharmacy had changed.

[<p><br/></p>, <p><br/>Now I have to locate a pharmacy that has same formula as what I was buying.</p>]
[<p><p>I am an 80-year-old, 18-year member of AARP and a customer of its mail-order pharmacy in Horsham, PA, from which, on May 09, I ordered by phone -- and received by mail a few days later -- the initial unit of a renewed prescription item called **, a narcotic analgesic and, of course, a controlled substance. On June 28, I called the pharmacy's 800 number to request the first of five refills, but the shipment got lost, stolen or perhaps was never sent at all. However, the pharmacy has now billed me for it and, in so doing, is implying that I am a liar and a thief. Meanwhile, since June 28, when I was promised, but have never received a duplicate order, I have initiated some 10 calls to pharmacy numbers, only one of which was returned following my doctor's personal intervention.</p></p>, <p>I am an 80-year-old, 18-year member of AARP and a customer of its mail-order pharmacy in Horsham, PA, from which, on May 09, I ordered by phone -- and received by mail a few days later -- the initial unit of a renewed prescription item called **, a narcotic analgesic and, of course, a controlled substance.

Hence, the liar-thief implication. On August 09, frustrated by lack of cooperation from evasive order-takers and unhelpful supervisors, I managed to get through to the chief pharmacist in Horsham to inform him that I'd written a detailed letter of complaint and wanted to mail him an undated draft for his comment and, perhaps, resolution of the problem, before sending it to AARP higher authority. I mailed the letter the same day. Unsurprisingly, there has been no response to it, not have I been able to reach the chief pharmacist even to obtain acknowledgement. So, the matter remains unresolved and the reasons for what is clearly bizarre and unprofessional behavior cry out for a rational explanation. A copy of my detailed letter is available by post or email. Thanks, meanwhile, for listening.</p>]
