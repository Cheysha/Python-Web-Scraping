*: I did a Walmart order for pick up on April 8th. On April 13th they debited my account for 107.38. Again on April 13th they debited my account for 107.38. I spent 2 days on the phone, email, and chat. Sent them all the documentation from my bank. They will not refund my money. They told me file a dispute with my bank. Now I have to take off work, go shut off my debit card, file a dispute. They are allowed to fraudulently steal from people and I have to pay the consequences.
*: Walmart Market Pharmacy in Northport, AL: IDK the name of the Asian pharmacist, but that's the only way I know to be specific about who. Every time I take scripts there, it's fine. But let me take a narcotic script there & you can see how she changes. She will talk loud about how this is a narcotic, IDK if we can fill or we don't have any of that, or narcotics make people drowsy. 
*: I unfortunately have CVS Caremark. Considering their auto-deny policy and overpriced prescriptions, I use Wal-Mart and ask for best cash price. Their people are friendly and usually outgoing to help with any problems I have, AND they offer BEST CASH PRICE on prescriptions. This is a sure win and you will be satisfied by their service.
*: I have a hard time comprehending how bad the experience can be in 2023. On hold for more than 40 minutes to refill a prescription because I need to change the credit card I have on file. Not sure if I will ever connect with anyone or if it will go on forever. It cannot tell me how long the wait is estimated to be. There is an option to get a call-back. I tried it, but it put me on hold for the callback system! After a long time waiting I hung up and re-called for the original wait. What's the point of waiting to schedule a call-back, the point is not to wait! I tried logging in online to do the same things but there is no option to change payment credit card. I cannot even refill the prescription online, it says to call the phone number. There is an option while on hold to leave a voicemail by pressing 1, but it doesn't work either. Really??
*: Went to Walmart with a prescription for my husband after just leaving the hospital, was told they couldn't read it so they couldn't fill it. We're in Florida so we then took the same prescription to Publix supermarket where they promptly and very kindly had no issue reading the prescription and filling it. Spoke with the doctor's office and was told it's at the discretion of the pharmacist if they have an issue with a prescription for any reason. Absolutely ridiculous and just shows how little Walmart pharmacist care. You could clearly see my husband was standing there with the neck brace, bands on his arm from the hospital as well as covering from two IVs. If a pharmacist at that point cares that little then I will never be back! I am moving all of his prescriptions away from Walmart.
*: I was to pick up a medicine for my wife and Walmart prepared the wrong one. I have to drive more than 5 miles, and Walmart has to delay and I had to come back in the afternoon? When the medicine was supposed to be available the day before. I have to agree with one of the reviews that it is not being laid back, it is laziness pure and simple.
*: If I could rate this store lower than 1-star I would. The attitudes are lazy, not laid back. John, the store manager is disingenuous when engaging on serious issue with the pharmacy concerning anti-epileptic medication or holding employees accountable. Walmart pharmacy's lax attitude in medication coordination is appalling and borderline negligent. The store's attitude reflects that of the manager. Buy your shower curtain there, but leave your pharmaceutical concerns to the professionals who are NOT affiliated with Walmart. Your health is too important and their attitude towards life and death medical issues is lazy and apathetic. Save yourself!
*: Walmart pharmacy on Tidewater Drive in Norfolk VA. One of her pharmacist stated my prescription would be done at 5pm. She talked to me any kind of way and then spoke with other customers about me & the situation while I'm still at the counter. I said, "All you have to do is apologize and keep it going." She says, "I'm not apologizing for ** I ain't done." Plus she spoke to me across the counter the entire time.
*: These people keep giving me the WRONG medication for my thyroids. I tell them everytime I have my meds refilled that I only take (**) Not ** because they don't seem to work with my body as (**) Does and yes there is a difference. I know this because I'm the one taking these pills. My thyroids gets out of control with this generic mess and my doctor can back that up! I've informed Wal-mart Pharmacy of this on several occasions and it makes no sense that everytime I go to have my prescription filled, that I have to continue to go through the same problem over and over...
*: I have have chronic pain, and have had surgery. I get a Schedule I medicine, and have gotten it for the last 5 years. I have prior authorization from my insurance. Now they are saying I need to tell them my diagnosis for the medicine. They said it’s been their policy for a few years. Today they want to enforce it on my prescription. After going round and round with the pharmacist, they filled it within 15 minutes of the call. I filed a complaint with the corporate office; waiting on a call back. I went there, and they were giggling ; just like when I was on the phone. The tech just looked at them for a few minutes before coming over, and she was rude. They played the game of having my prescription behind the counter, and the pharmacist had to give the rude tech the bag. She took her time again, and was rude.
*: I made an error in my original review. I said I was still waiting for my prescription on April 27. It's actually April 20. After I finished my review, I received a text saying my prescription is ready. That's two weeks after the doctor called in the prescription.
*: After being prescribed a medication that my normal pharmacy (Walgreens) didn't have on hand & would not look to see if other Walgreens in the area had it either...I went on a hunt for it myself. Having contracted shingles and in immense pain, I called up every pharmacy & grocery store within a 30-mile radius to find antiviral eyedrops since my eye was surrounded & it could cause permanent eye damage if the virus were to spread to my eye. My local Walmart pharmacy was my last call. 
*: I have a 17 yr old autistic child who takes meds. Is on Medicaid and last yr I had no issues with Walmart. His insurance paid for them. This yr one of his meds they told me would be 96 one would be 76 and one 21. A person on Medicaid normally cannot pay that much money for medicine. Would have had no issue with being on the 4.00 list. I switched over to Hy-Vee pharmacy. Same exact meds and his insurance paid for all. Will not use Walmart pharmacy again
*: They did not send my script and didn’t notify me that I needed refills. I called and was given different directions each time I called and I’m still without my meds. I wish my insurance never chose Walmart for my home delivery.
*: Came to pick up husband's meds in drive through 10 minutes before they are supposed to close for lunch. The pharmacy tech got my meds and took my bank card and driver's license and walked away without handing my meds or bank card. And walked away and went to lunch. Left me sitting waiting in the drive through. Never came back. I had to go park and go inside to customer service and ask for store manager. I explained what happened. She took me to get pharmacist which was on her lunch. She stated she was upset because I interrupted her lunch. I explained I needed my card and meds and was left in drive through. And that that was very unacceptable customer service. I called corporate of Walmart and haven't heard anything from them. I have been told they will call me.
*: First time I got yelled at. I was asking the pharmacist a question and she proceeded to yell at me saying, "You can't just come here and expect your prescription to be here every week" when all I was doing was ask her a question about the amount of the prescription and then today I'm waiting in line because they are closed for lunch but the line was so long so I waited on the side. So when the last person that was in front of me was done someone got in front of me and cut me off so I waited and then I got in front with a pharmacist and she looked at me all mad because she thought I was cutting people and I told her, "I've been here before the last person you seen. I would never call anybody off" but I'm giving her my license as I say that and then she's yelling starts yelling saying, "What do you want? You just giving me your license. What do you want?" So I'm telling her I want my prescription.
*: I have been getting my medications from Walmart pharmacy store no. 1998 Skokie IL. for more than 5 years, always I am having a great service from this pharmacy and they treat my like I am the most important patient. The pharmacists and the technicians are very kind, friendly and professional. I really appreciate their help and concerns.
*: Pharmacists at my local Walmart take a personal interest in my health. They take time to discuss my prescriptions and health issues with me especially if they sense a problem. Most every pharmacy associate is knowledgeable and caring. I'd stand in line there any day rather than deal with an impersonal online pharmacy.
*: Not that you have much choice in who specialty prescriptions are processed through, but they are awful. My wife's employer just switched to them 1/1/21. I have had the same call at least 4 times over and over again to get my needed injection in time. I am told it is being processed just to get repeat calls about the same thing days later. I WAS PROMISED IT WOULD BE DELIVERED TO DOCTOR TUESDAY. Just got called again today Thursday to process meaning it will not be there on time. Lackadaisical and no concern about the health impact of this needed shot. Said it was held up for $5 co-pay that by the way we authorized and provided information for twice previously. Not looking forward to dealing with these knuckleheads every 12 weeks.
*: My insurance only reimbursed specialty drugs through them, so I had to fill here for about 2 years. Every month you have to call in and speak to a rep who transfers you to a pharmacist who second guesses the doctor’s prescription. Sometimes you have to get your prescription resent because they do not keep good records of what happened in months prior. Then you get transferred back to the reps who rehash everything like you did not just spend an hour on the phone and schedule delivery. No other pharmacy is this bureaucratic and incompetent.
*: WalMart is huge but still their pharmacy workers treat you like you are the most important patient, getting the right meds to you on time and at the best price.
*: I love the lower priced medications compared to many other pharmacies. Usually have medications in stock and quick and friendly service.
*: I switched from one pharmacy to Walmart years ago and have been with this pharmacy ever since. The customer service is wonderful. The prices have been very affordable now on most of my meds.
*: Prompt, courteous, informative and supportive. I always feel welcome. Even though they might be very busy, I always feel like they listen and care about my well being.
*: Everyone in Huntsville AR Walmart are so friendly and helpful. As soon as I walk up someone is coming to the register to help me. They ask questions and give me information on my prescriptions.
*: The pharmacist tells me whether it would be a good time to get various vaccinations, based on the prescriptions I'm filling that day. In addition to having low prices, the staff cares about customers.
*: Very kind, professional pharmacist at our Northport, Alabama Walmart location. My husband and I are retired and on a limited income. They care for us and watch out for us regarding our medications.
*: Wal-Mart pharmacies offer reduced prices for Military Retired (me). They are easy to locate, offer fast service, and will even call you when your prescription needs refilled (if you want).
*: Walmart has discounted me and my family when we need our medicine sometimes when I did not have enough money at the time to pay. Walmart has great service.
*: I am very pleased that my local WalMart Pharmacy takes part in a program with a brand name drug that I take on a daily basis. If they did not do that, I would have a difficult time obtaining it.
*: I like Walmart Pharmacy because they are always friendly, professional, and they also have curbside pickup which is very helpful. I have never had a problem with Walmart pharmacy.
*: They're very flexible; they'll send text when your RX is ready to be filled & ask if you want it filled now or later. Also if you're out of town they'll transfer your script to a store close by.
*: Often the least expensive, but sometimes a hassle. Door near pharmacy is locked so you have to walk all the way around the store to get to pharmacy. Some techs are nice, other not very friendly.
*: I have had mostly a good experience. Usually it's cheapest and not as slow as some of the others not many times I have had any issues.
*: I like Walmart pharmacy because the pharmacists and the cashiers are very friendly. If you have a question they are very polite. If you can not find something they will come out from behind the counter.
*: Walmart has cheaper medications through my insurance, however the lines are really long sometimes. I do like the drive-through option but again the lines sometimes are long.
*: Walmart is a good pharmacy but many times people are very busy and lines are longer. They go to lunch and close the doors and we have to wait for them to come back. Since that experience I never order.
*: I use Walmart Pharmacy for all of my prescription needs. I find the techs to be knowledgeable and friendly. The pharmacies is always available to answer any questions I might have without a long wait.
*: My local Walmart pharmacy staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. They always provide practical suggestions when picking up a script. They always ask about the family and make you feel special.
*: I called and wanted to transfer my prescription from one location to another, I felt like I was a bother to the woman on the phone, who didn't give me a time, and when I got there over an hour later and was speaking with the pharmacist the women next to her jumped in and once again gave her attitude. The ONLY reason I use Walmart pharmacy is because Walgreens no longer accepts my insurance. The prescriptions are NEVER ready when they say that they will be. Very disappointed! I would rather change my insurance company than to continue to use Walmart!
*: The Walmart pharmacy in Williamstown, NJ is terrific. The pharmacist is knowledgeable, attentive, professional and personable. I never wait more than 20 minutes for a prescription refill. I like receiving a text message when my prescription is ready for pick up and the reminder call if I forget to pick up my prescription. I switched from the Turnersville Walmart pharmacy because of the poor customer service and the Williamstown pharmacy provides a high level of customer service from all of the pharmacy staff.
*: I feel it was a great experience. I am greeted with a friendly smile and my medications are ready when I arrive. I trust them when talking with them about my prescriptions.
*: The pharmacists are awesome at their jobs and very informative. My only problem is with the pharmaceutical industry wanting to put patients in debt for meds that everyone is needing.
*: The service is hit and miss. Sometimes it's great and others it's awful. I have had to wait over an hour with sick kids because it was a new medicine and I had to talk to the pharmacist and he talked with other customers that were there after I was before he talked with me. There was no procedure to let him know who was first. If I don't have to have a consult it's pretty good time-wise.
*: I have been using Wal-Mart Pharmacy for several years now. When I go in it's like going into a small town pharmacy like I grew up with. The pharmacist and most of his team always greet me by name and even recognize me when I call in. The pharmacist is always available for consultation no matter how busy and he doesn't make you wait forever. Really awesome pharmacy and pharmacy team!
*: The pharmacy team at Wal-Mart provides excellent customer service. They have courtesy calls to remind you to refill your prescription and the prescription is filled immediately. They call your insurance company if there are coverage questions, and have the lowest prices. One time I was called by the pharmacist because she was concerned over the many prescriptions I was given when I was dealing with some health issues and wanted to check on me.
*: The Wal-Mart Pharmacy's best feature is the low cost. However, as is my experience at most Wal-Mart's they fall down on available assistance, professionalism, courtesy, consistency and attention to detail in fulfilling Rx orders. It doesn't seem like the employees are cohesive or work as a team at all.
*: They are knowledgeable, friendly, convenient. I can do all my shopping there also. I can rely on their hours and knowledge of those products they offer. I enjoy going to Walmart for all my needs.
*: I am unaware of Wal-Mart Pharmacy having a reward program. If they do, it is not advertised well. Otherwise, I am very pleased with Wal-Mart Pharmacy. The workers are always quick and efficient and the pharmacist is knowledgeable or will find the answer to any question I have had with my medications.
*: At FM 1960 & Eldridge, they asked me to take a partial supply of a tier 4 medication. I did & then was denied the rest of the meds which supposedly expired. As an M.S. patient this is very disruptive causing me to be without meds for more than 1 week. Very fishy.
*: Recently I went to a Wal-Mart Pharmacy to get my prescriptions. I just moved to this area and have only been coming to specific Wal-Mart since January of this year. I am a diabetic and I certain medications I take daily. Well the last time I went they said that my insurance would not let me get only a month which is not their fault but they said I never been to them before which I have. They said I have never received this medicine before either. I have been going to Wal-Mart for awhile now. Never have I had such trouble with people working there. I almost wanted to change my pharmacy.
*: They can seldom fill an Rx all the way. Many times, even though called in, you will wait an hour or more. Many of us travel 110 miles round trip thus being shorted really messes things up.
*: They have a great program. They offer great prices, always prompt and always explain things. They offer free flu shots and are always friendly. Sometimes you have to wait at certain hours but not long. They are very good.
*: Many times there have been issues when my doctor has said they sent multiple RX orders to them electronically but they say they have not received all of them or they tell you your RX is ready but when you get there to pick it up, it isn't. Also, there have been some pricing discrepancies at times.
*: Walmart pharmacy is slow at filling prescriptions and the staff is not very friendly. I get my meds filled there sometimes only because their hours are convenient. The pharmacist is generally pretty nice if you have a question. Otherwise I wouldn't go there and I wouldn't recommend friends or family to go there unless they had to.
*: I also use a mail order pharmacy but if I need something quicker, I use Walmart. The pharmacists are kind and knowledgeable. Their prices are very good and I will continue to use them in a pinch.
*: The pharmacy services are exceptionally great. The staff members goes above and beyond the call of duty to see to it that the customers are properly served and taken care of the course of their duty(ies) and work ethics. I especially love their cordial invitations, courtesy(ies) and smiles, as well as saying WELCOME TO WALMART. The employees really makes my day, even to the point when it seems to me that I am down and out. PLEASE let them know how much I enjoy just coming to the store [Walmart] and being serviced on a whole.
*: Some Walmarts are better than others. In their Neighborhood Market the wait time is wonderfully short; however their local Superstore often has a wait time of 30-40 minutes.
*: My pharmacy is fine except for the fact that they completely shut down for lunch. With that you either wait or return later. Not so convenient then. Also there is no reward program at Walmart.
*: I wish all drug stores had more natural information. I think people also need to be aware of how to help themselves with medication as well natural methods.
*: I enjoy shopping at Wal-Mart Pharmacy. It is in my neighborhood. In addition, the hours are convenient and the wait-time is fair. However, they need to improve on their customer service. One young lady is very rude and unfriendly. If I didn't need my meds I wouldn't shop when she is working. She never smiles, extends a greeting or a thank you. I am on a fixed budget and recovering from breast cancer. I asked the customer service personnel not to refill my cancer meds, but to fill my diabetic and HB meds. When I picked up my prescriptions it was everything I didn't ask for. Overall, I am pleased with my Wal-Mart Pharmacy services, but expecting improvements.
*: I have been to other pharmacies and Wal-Mart is the only one that I have had great service from. The wait time to pick up my medications has never been a long wait for me and service is excellent and they make sure before you leave you talk to a pharmacist first. To understand what one is picking up and if one has any questions to ask. I like that because I would only talk to the assistant unless one wants to talk to the pharmacist.
*: I really enjoy using Wal-Mart Pharmacy. They have been very helpful with changes in medications and assisting with problems with existing prescriptions. I do wish their pharmacy hours were a little better on the weekends, but everyone needs time with their family.
*: Most of the time the Pharmacist that I deal with is awesome but on his days off the person that takes his place is not as patient and kind. I would love to see some kind of incentive or reward program put in place. Also it would be great to offer some type of program for the customers with no prescription coverage or even a program that would allow someone that is a loyal customer special discounts.
*: I do not have a lot of prescriptions to fill. I may only have one a year. The times I have used them I have not had any issues. It is convenient because it is on the way home.
*: The round ** that Walmart always seems to give me work very little or not at all. The last batch seemed toxic, offered no relief, and made me feel more ill. Their computer says, and I have reminded them many times, that I want oval ** which work fine, relieves stress, and no side effects. The round .5 ** seem filled with junk that does nothing for you. Too bad not returnable! A lab should check what's in this junk. They conveniently almost always only have the round, so take it or wait for delivery.
*: Went to Walmart Pharmacy to buy **. Girl told me ** was its generic. I was not allowed to see the box. Got in the car and it said on the box it was ** which is more likely to make you drowsy which is the reason I wanted ** instead. Of course it is non-refundable which I totally understand. I never had an opportunity to see the box. The box was hidden from me until it was paid for. I asked her twice if it was ** and she assured me it was. I was really an inconvenience to her because she did not want to have to wait in customers. I called the store when I got home and realized that ** tends to cause more drowsiness which I am sensitive to. The pharmacy just said, "Too bad." I am out $16.98 with meds I can't take and nothing to take. No one at the store really cares either. Very frustrated.
*: I had my 2nd negative experience at Walmart Pharmacy today! I have been on a maintenance medication for 4 yrs now, I am stable and I work for a drug and alcohol crs program, which I am a supervisor at that! When I tried to have my script filled I was called by the pharmacy 25 mins later and they told me to pick up my prescription, and THEY WERE NOT COMFORTABLE FILLING IT, and I had it filled by them the previous month.
*: As long as your medication is covered by insurance Walmart is like any other one - except for customer service and courtesy. However, if your insurance is not covering the medication then you know what a highway rubber it is, 2 examples: ** - a pre-surgery medication for people on ** is $465 (it's $72.19 in Costco). Is there any regulation to stop these from stealing? ** 30 pc $89 (it's $23 in Costco and $27 in Sam's).
*: Walmart Pharmacy is extremely frustrating. Time after time, again and again they can't seem to package my medicine in the bottles instead of those cardboard pill boxes. I am sorry to say, I cannot open those boxes and have to cut them with scissors. There is a note in my file but they do not care to even check their work. I sincerely hope they aren't mixing up the medicines for people on a regular basis as they mix up how to dispense them to their customers. I am done with them! Don't use them unless you have to.
*: I have had a cold for a couple of days now. My husband was going to our local WalMart (which is about 20 minutes away in Decatur, IN) for some other things. I asked him to get me some **. He went to the pharmacy window and asked to purchase some **. He was asked if the medicine was for him and he responded "no, it is for my wife who is back home sick." They then proceeded to tell him that the medicine could only be purchased by the person who needs it. Which is a crock. Indiana state law states that the person purchasing it can be questioned by the pharmacist about why it is being purchased, who is it for, etc. The pharmacist then denied the sale of the medicine. 
*: Polite, competent staff when I pick up at the store, But... 5 STARS! This is what put them over the top. I have never in my lifetime had a real person call me up to tell me my prescription would be ready in 2 days. Not a automated machine. Keep up the great customer service Burnsville.
*: Verbally attacked and attempting to physically attack - I was at Wal-Mart last Friday to pick up medications due to having surgery last Monday. I was given misinformation in regards to my medications and was frustrated. The pharmacy manager didn't like what I said which was not threatening of any form, although Brittany ** attempted to physically fight me as I was sitting on bench while telling me I was ignorant. Also telling me that I would brain surgery although I had the other surgery Monday. She called security which I don't know why because I had surgery and was in no shape to even defend myself physically. I told them that I would leave once I got her name to call and file a complaint. 
*: Was told on February 2, 2017 that ** 25mg for my mother in law would be in on the 3rd. The next day we arrived to pick it up to be told they don't know who spoke with me but deliveries come on Tuesday. Presented today February 6, 2017 to pick up med. This time I am told that I will get a partial fill (3 pills) as the remainder won't be in until Thursday February 8, 2017. I give up! Taking all meds and transferring to Walgreens. ** is a med that must be continued. Being told three different things is really not acceptable.
*: Tonight was the last straw after two days and I don't know how many phone calls and trips to the store and still no prescription. EJ the pharmacist is rude, incompetent, and could care less about the customers. I will never step foot in another Walmart as long as I live. They left me with no medication for the night all the while whining about needing to get home, no one seems to know what the heck is going on or did anything to help. If Walmart was smart they would fire the whole unprofessional staff and start over!
*: I've never had a problem with this pharmacy. The pharmacist caught an error when one of my doctors prescribed a ** medication for me and I'm allergic to **. They contacted the doctor's office and got a new script for me (without **) and this was late on a Friday afternoon. The wait time isn't bad, but I'm impatient and it seems to take about 4-5 minutes to complete each person's transactions, including mine. They do not have a reward program that I am aware of.
*: My main reason for using Walmart pharmacy is that the store sells many other things. However, you do have to wait about 1/2 hour if dropping off a new prescription when they're busy, but at least at Walmart you can get other shopping accomplished or find interesting things to look at while you wait. Once, I phoned in a refill and it was not ready when I arrived the next day. Also, once when I picked up prescriptions, one was not in the bag and I had to drive back to town and wait for it to be filled. Usually things go smoothly though and prices are good.
*: Overall they were good in all categories. I don't have much experience or more like ailments to need to fill prescriptions from the pharmacy. However, I find the pharmacy in my local Walmart good on providing me with the information I need and a price better than any other local pharmacies.
*: The Wal-Mart pharmacy I use has no reward program but I have never had any trouble. If they cannot get it where you can afford it with discount Rx cards, they will tell you which pharmacy will be able to.
*: Been using the Walmart Pharmacy on Route 7 in Norwalk for the last three years and the experience has always been pleasant with the exception of the costs related to the prescribed drugs. Having said that, they are still the cheapest and better than most by comparison to any Walgreens, Rite-Aid, etc.. They're also convenient to me travel wise, and they're accommodating and knowledgeable. They are the 'go-to' pharmacy in this area of Fairfield county.
*: A lot of the time they don't have what you need and they offer a couple of days to get you through. They are very slow, not very friendly and don't always get Rx right too many times. Left to another pharmacy.
*: Hours are not bad but not a 24 hour pharmacy. The pharmacist don't seem to be any worse or better than any place else. The wait time is terrible. Often the phone system will say it will be ready in a few hours then I go there and find out they don't even have it and it's not ready for several days. They don't call you to tell you it's not in. They make you go there, wait in line only to find out that you wasted your time. But they have lower prices.
*: I go to a neighborhood market so it's smaller. Small town feel, pharmacist's get to know you on a personal basis and most of the people at the pharmacy know my name so I love it. There's no reward program but great prices as always!
*: I'm pleased with the services Walmart provides. Compared to other pharmaceutical companies or drugstores Walmart is the one I choose to shop with. The pharmacists are caring and understanding about any questions you might have about the medication and I wouldn't go anywhere else because of their courtesy.
*: Oct. 2, 2016 I went online for my medication refills. I picked them up Oct. 4. The next day when I started my refill of ** I noticed it looked very different. I call the pharmacy but was told sometimes they get their meds from different companies therefore they may look different. I started the medication. After taking it one morning and try to drive I had to pull over and call someone to pick me up. A couple of days later I had to go to the E.R. but didn't take my meds with me. After almost two weeks of taking this I was retaining so much fluid I became short of breath just walking across the room. I went to my primary care doctor this time taking my meds. I wasn't taking **. I was taking ** a narcotic. I went to the pharmacy manager who laughed and said “I bet you were sleeping a lot.” He went on to say they had not carried them by that company for sometime but I was promised answers. He never called me and refused to take my call.
*: I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to pick up the prescription and if they don't have what I need in stock they will order it and I will normally have it within 24 to 36 hours. Also, the pharmacist is knowledgeable and the counter staff is friendly and helpful.
*: They are always there ready to help with any questions or problems that I may be having with a doctors offices. They not only help with prescriptions but also with over the counter products. And they can tell me when its time to maybe see a doctor.
*: Walmart is convenient for everyone. If you need it, they got it. Having other stores to franchise with is a way to do business. Walmart service me like no other. There were time when I ordered prescriptions. They were prompt when telling me that they didn't have it. They called around to find out who does. If possible, they placed orders to have prescriptions sent to the patient's address. Walmart is my number one department store. In choosing Walmart, they are the most effective and efficient way to buy prescriptions.
*: I am satisfied with service. The people are great, always smiling and ready to serve you. They will answer any question you might have regarding your prescriptions and will even call the doctor's office if something isn't right. I have never had a bad experience and actually love the professionalism from all the staff. I would recommend Walmart pharmacy to all my friends. The experience is well worth it and so are the prices. Plus you can shop while you wait or just browse. My favorite place is the craft section. Always love to see what they have. Who could ask for better a place where you can get all your needs.
*: The people are always friendly and professional. They are awesome, but the wait times are sometimes excessive. When a doctor prescribes medications that may have a problem with others, the pharmacist is quick to advise...
*: I go to Kroger pharmacy because the store I was getting my supplies closed and some of the employees from that store went to Kroger's and so did I. They're well stocked, quite knowledgeable, friendly and have a convenient location.
*: The past 2 times I've tried to get my medication filled the people at the drop off counter have had to see my ID. They take it and write all over my script. Maybe there are new FDA rules? But explain what you are doing please? That wouldn't be an issue if they didn't then tell me it could take hours OR DAYS to have this med authorized by the pharmacist. NOT my insurance... a person who decides if it's ok to fill a medicine. A preauth is PERFECTLY FINE... that I understand because the meds are expensive.
*: They have always did a great job. From day 1 when I went into Wal-Mart they've always helped me and they have good personalities. The pharmacist is very helpful describing your prescription and how to use them. They give you a smile, your prescription and tells you to have a good day.
*: They have no rewards program and sometimes doesn't have medication in stock. They have a considerable turnover of staff and good prices generally, but not always.
*: There is no reward program and the wait sometimes is long to tell you they are out of your prescription. Also, the reps are not very personable. Line's long unless time it right, and they're closed on Sunday for lunch break which I never knew until it happened to me. Their hours' real short when Sunday is a lot of people's day off.
*: The price for prescriptions is a huge help for seniors. My Medicare RX plan has doubled this year, my bad... I trusted AARP to take care of us seniors. Now I will have a difficult time paying for a plan that I am not even using because Walmart is much better priced for scripts. Had I researched in October I would not be with AARP Medicare RX plan. I would be on the Walmart plan. $22.00 a month instead of $72 a month!!
*: I love the saving, but you have to in long lines and they close for lunch at bad times. I go there cause they have $4 medicines, but not crazy about the lines and wait times. Wish they had a drive thru service, but otherwise I like it.
*: Wal-Mart is a nice place to shop and it's close to home. The workers are pleasant and the store usually has what our family is shopping for. When we're shopping if we can't locate an item they don't mind helping us look for it even if they need to go in storage to get it.
*: I'm very happy with their services, and they answer all my question so I understand them. I can only say how happy I am with all services that Wal-Mart pharmacy has to offer.
*: After having an issue in the Pharmacy at the Ontario, Oregon store, I attempted to contact the Corporate office! I called the toll free Walmart number. The women who answered was polite, listened to me and read back what I said, it was correct. She then stated the Pharmacy was a separate entity, she would send my issues to that business. I was told that someone would call me within three business days. I waited seven business days and called Walmart back. Talked to another polite woman; repeated the same issue and was told I would receive a call from a Supervisor because no one called me. Well, it is now six months later! My issue wasn't big but I would LIKE an answer!!! I know Walmart makes many millions of dollars each year (probably each month), but we all deserve a listening ear!!!
*: This is the worst pharmacy service ever. Our family uses this pharmacy, including to purchase meds for our French bully. Every time I take a prescription for our dog, this store loses the script or it's misplaced, and it take one or two days to get the medicine. For our human meds, the store routinely takes 60 minutes to 3 hours to have prescriptions filled. Never mind the six to eight Walmart coats behind the pharmacy counter working. This time it took two days and a phone call to the vet before I could get the meds for my dog. When the lines waiting to pick up meds becomes long, the cashiers pay no mind to the 12, 13, 14, 15 people waiting while getting into conversations with the customers and most of the customers are too ignorant to remember the number of people STILL waiting. Last, The cashier checking me out was extremely rude and hateful.
*: I am a patient taking ** for about 2 years. As of this years the pens for this 5 times the strength ** was available. I take a high dose of ** every day due to my condition. I use from 50 to 100 unit from a marked syringe **. This means the dose in ** is at Maximum of 500 units per day. I am explaining this because the pharmacist did not understand the dose amount conversion and I could not fill the prescription. I understood the Prescription must be in ** dose units and that was ok and so I proceeded to call my doctor to write me a new Prescription with the right units dose per day of 500 units. I tried for a week calling my doctor, according to his office manager the Pharmacist gave him the advise I was wrong in the dose and do not write the prescription out, it is too dangerous. This office manager then relayed the issue to the PCP and listened to the ill given advise that was way out of line on the Pharmacist. 
*: The only medication that seems to lower my blood pressure is ** which has been only available in brand name version, not generic up until recently when the patent expired and now it is manufactured under the name ** instead of **. Today when I went to the pharmacy I was told my insurance would not pay and that my medication would cost $220. They said they faxed the doctor for another covered drug but no one had gotten back to them. They never told me they would do this, I don't want another medication. I have been taking ** for almost a year now. My insurance has been paying for it all along. However now, apparently because ** is available and a lot less expensive they will not pay for the brand name version. Apparently they refused to pay for the generic equivalent as well. This is for a heart patient that has an enlarged aorta. 
*: I have an ACL tear and hobbled to the pharmacy for pain meds. I didn't have my drug card and asked the girl if it was ok with my health card since I'm in Trenton at my sister's and not in Belleville. She said ok and gave me the beeping pager. I hobbled around the store and returned to pharmacy when pager went off only to be told it's not ready. As I sat with tears rolling down my face, learning my blood pressure is through the roof, I was told I need my drug card in Belleville! Thanks if I don't die first!!!
*: Every time I go to pick up my medicine the head pharmacist wants to tell me what I can take and wants to withhold my medicine so I end up calling my doctor and having a big problem because the pharmacist thinks he's my doctor. We get medication because we are sick and to put us thru extra stress is unfair and simply wrong. The other problem is the language barrier.... No one speaks English so it's always a miscommunication and occasionally I get so upset I feel like I'm going to pass out. Third, they take forever to call you and it's always people complaining and walking off cussing it's like crazy to get a prescription and I think it needs to be looked into and so I'm going to change my pharmacy because I'm sick and I'm feeling worse when I leave the pharmacy.
*: Walmart Pharmacy in Payson AZ is a crap shoot at its best. The ENTIRE staff are RUDE and HATEFUL to say the least and WalMart Pharmacy online is ** as well. I am going to take my business to Walgreens or CVS from now on. Because WalMart Pharmacy as a whole is **. You stand in line for what to save a few bucks to only get up to the counter to be treated like crap by rude and disgusting associates. Then you are treated like a criminal and have to go over to another line to get the same drugs you have gotten for YEARS to have to be schooled by pharmacist that DO NOT speak clear english. WALMART is CRAP for nothing.
*: I have went this Walmart three times. The first took them 1 hr 45 min to fill my prescription. They kept telling me they did not receive it from the doc. office yet (I HAVE FOUND OUT WAS B.S.). THE SECOND TIME TOOK THEM 1 1/2 HOURS TO FILL (SECOND TIME WAS 2 YEARS LATER). The third time they told me the same ** as before, then after an hour they told me they did not have the product. In today's tech world they should be able to tell. I was told by the doctor that they are told to tell the customers that they have not received the prescription yet but the truth is they have but it has not been fill yet. How about the truth. I went to Walgreens after the third visit at Walmart. WOW what a difference. The total opposite. They just earned my business. Bye Walmart.
*: After using another pharmacy with indifferent service and a 24 hour refill time, I decided to try the Walmart pharmacy, store 1164. I was amazed at the phenomenal experience I have enjoyed over the last few years. I am served immediately. The whole staff always ask about my teenage daughters. At most I only have to wait 15 minutes for my prescription to be filled. They will take the time to take customers to the locations of over-the-counter products they inquire about. Pharmacy Manager/Pharmacist Yasmin, Pharmacist Lauren, and the entire staff work seamlessly to provide this important service. I have also noticed the professional service which they provide other customers, as well. I feel total satisfaction every time I patronize this pharmacy!
*: Upon going to pick up my son's Rx (a UDI of **), being disabled, unemployed and broke I was really with crossed fingers of getting out with the generic equivalents tonight. With my son's father's med/Rx coverage he gets $5 generic scripts and $40+ brand. Tonight at 7 pm when the cashier at my Super WM told me the price I of course was taken back, saddened and asked if it comes in generic? The cashier gave me a puzzled look, told me she don't know what's what, called the pharmacist (a new one I have never seen btw) over who I asked again, by chance this one (pointing to the bag with the asthma inhaler) come in generic??
*: Every month I have dealt with Walmart taking days to fill my prescriptions but the last 2 weeks has been just absolutely ridiculous. They refused to fill one of my medications and told me my doctor had to fill in additional information or I had to call my insurance company to find out what they covered, which my doctor's office said is never done. It is the pharmacists' job to call the insurance company, not mine.
*: Dropped a simple eye drop prescription off with all my required documents. The drop off woman told me 20 minutes, gave them that long, came back and they told me an additional 15 minutes & were very rude when I asked how many people were waiting ahead of me. She proceeded to tell me to basically deal with it and there was nothing they can do and I'll be taken when they can get to it all while multiple techs stood around with a smirk on their faces. Very ignorant and condescending hand should be trained on customer service skills and giving proper timing.
*: Monday our son's prescription for a lower dose of medication was sent to the pharmacy. The Dr sent it for generic and the insurance only pays for the name brand. So we called the Dr and she sent over the correct script. It was for 20 mg **. Our son has epilepsy and the ** is an addition to his seizure medication to control seizures. His dose was lowered on Sept 6th due to his levels being too high. We filled at a different pharmacy (which has limited hours) his old dose of the higher ** on August 27th. When he went to the Dr on Sept 6th we were told to immediately lower the dose.
*: We rarely get prescriptions. My husband had dental surgery and we had to get 3 prescriptions. Went to Walmart Pharmacy on Redbud in McKinney. Dropped off the prescriptions. Came back in 40 minutes to pick up and find out that I needed to provide the insurance card when I dropped off so I had to go back to drop off window. The tech did not know how to apply our insurance card, said because the card shows 12/15 it must be out of date. I call the insurance company and they explain the insurance was renewed annually in Oct and cards were distributed before the first of the new year. The insurance rep reviews the same information with the tech and she finally approved it. So I spend another 35 minutes waiting on all this to get done. Totally inefficient and unnecessary, Walmart needs to train their techs better.
*: It was on the weekend and no other pharmacies are open during these hours in a small town, so I was stuck with Walmart. I had my prescription called in there and went to pick it up. Waited 1.5 hours, and they said "another 30 minutes." I was done. Older ** lady was VERY rude and I needed to get into bed. I planned to return in the morning for the meds. After checking the sign to make sure they would be open, I returned on Sunday. Pharmacy was closed! My lesson is NEVER use Walmart again. I am a local nurse and I will make sure to pass on my experience to my patients. I believe in paying for good service and I will stand on that again by using my small local pharmacy. It is worth every penny.
*: I was released from a Hospital this past Saturday. Wal-Mart was nearby the interstate on our way home so wanting to hurry & get home & get in bed, my wife stopped and ran in to see if she could get my meds filled in a timely manner, explaining about her ailing husband being outside in the car. She was told there would be a security check since the meds were narcotics. Unbeknowing to her, they got my cell number from their records and called me and told me I would need to answer a number of questions before they could fill it. They asked if he was aware that I was in the store trying to fill his meds. They even questioned him about what kind of surgery he had!!! He told them to come out to the white Chevy Equinox in the corner parking lot where they would find him, unable to walk with leg pumps on each leg and they could verify his reason for not coming in!! Unbelievable!!
*: Pharm Tech named Demitri at Beaufort SC store was very helpful in finding the appropriate log ins for me to utilize manufacturer coupons to help reduce cost of 3 ophthalmic Rxs from $700 to $360. She took the time and interest in assisting me in my first Wal-Mart Rx experience. I will now transfer all my Rxs to Walmart.
*: First of all I do not like going to Walmart. Several times I've had bad experiences with the service in Walmart and the situation that the parking area. Being a disabled person is difficult for me to get out. I do drive but I can never find an electric scooter that either works or is charged up to use. My complaint is not about my purchasing a pharmaceutical item. It is more about the Privacy a customer has in the pharmacy. I could go on about this but I don't know how much time or words I can use. I came to pick up a prescription and drop off a prescription so I didn't have to go back again to pick up the one I was dropping off.
*: I want to start by saying, I am by no means perfect and have made many mistakes through out my life, as everybody makes mistakes, it's just how it is. Anyhow... a few years back I was getting a medication that I needed to see the MD every month, and need to sign a contract that I would not get this medication from anyone else but her (no it's not pain meds). Everything was going good for the first 3 months and all of a sudden I get a letter in the mail saying she cannot be my physician any longer because I was seeing another MD. I was so confused, I called the office and they confirmed what the letter said. Of course I argued and said that I was not seeing anyone else etc.
*: I spend over $2000.00 dollars every month at the Dublin VA Wal-Mart. My complaint is having to talk to the pharmacist every time I get a prescription refilled. If it is a new medication I would understand but this is medication I have taken a long time. I was told today (7/25/16) by a very rude cashier (she is rude all the time. Her name is Amanda.) it was store policy and she refused to give me my medicine until the pharmacist said it was ok. I have talked to the pharmacist before and they have never given me any information that my dr has not gone over with me (I am not complaining about the pharmacist. They do a good job.). If I have a question I will ask to speak to a PHARMACIST but I will not be forced to talk to one. My Dr takes care of me, not the pharmacist. If this is store policy somebody needs to change it because I hate it.
*: I called my refill in 3 days ago. The tech then looked on another computer and discovered the birthday was wrong although this had been corrected 2 scripts prior. This was the latest in a slew of problems with this pharmacy. They blamed it on the dr.'s office. Although it was a REFILL. I walked over to the other area shaking my head muttering that it was always problems here. The clerk Christina looked up and rudely stated it wasn't their fault, they can't help what the dr inputs. As the transaction continued she remained rude and demeaning. I had stepped away, upset, then returned. I asked for her name and informed her that she had been unacceptably rude. She flipped her name tag around and stated, "Christine, do you want to speak to my supervisor? He's right there". He had witnessed everything.
*: I have been ill with my throat. Used Doctor On Demand. Got diagnosed with Strep. I cannot swallow without excruciating pain. Called the pharmacy and was told prescription would be ready at 11 am. Husband went to pick up prescription at 12 pm. He was told it will not be ready until 12:30 pm. He asked, "Why?" He was told other prescriptions were ahead of mine. That makes no sense. When I was told it would be ready at 11 am, wasn't there other prescriptions ahead of mine? I was on the phone with him and her tone of voice to him was nasty. God knows why I am so ill that I could not collect it myself. If you can avoid them please do so. You may die if your medication is needed to save your life.
*: I picked up 3 RX's after being at urgent care for an ear infection in both ears. I did not feel well at all. Wal-mart stores are always hot in the summer. I waited 30 minutes to get a RX filled that couldn't be called in. When I got back to stand in line a man was having difficulty and took some time (not his fault), but I picked mine up and she the tech said this one needs counsel. I said "oh the ear drops?" She said yes. I said "I don't need one - it'll be ok. I'm a nurse. I can hang with the ear drops." I was trying to be helpful. They were busy. I don't need counsel on ear drops. But, the pharmacist was trying to tell something (both ears are stuffed up) and I heard her say "there are two bottles to make 10 ml." I said ok and went home. Finally. The drops were for the eyes... so, I called to just ask if maybe it was a mix up... the person who answered the phone cut me off and set the phone down.
*: I am unable to login to my Walmart Pharmacy account online. After successfully signing in to my Walmart account, I select the link for "Pharmacy Account/Manage your Prescriptions", which takes you to the "Online Pharmacy" login page. You are then asked to enter your date of birth in mm/dd/yyyy format, and click the "Go To Pharmacy" button, but after doing this nothing happens. It just sits at the webpage, not displaying any error messages or anything. The "create an Rx Profile" link does the exact same thing; I also tried with a different web browser but that didn't work either. It's very frustrating.
*: I went to Walmart in Riverdale, Georgia. I went to fill a prescription and I did not have insurance so the pharmacy staff provided me with a prescriptions saving app that allowed me to purchase a much-needed prescription at half the cost. I am extremely grateful for the pharmacy staff as I feel they went above and beyond call of duty to save customer. This type of customer service is great and I believe should not go unrecognized. So great job Walmart pharmacy staff. Keep up the good work.
*: I filled several prescriptions on 6-3-2016. The pharmacist told me out his mouth that "we really can't do partial refills on narcotics" but did so anyway, without informing me when the medication would be available. So I called the pharmacy on 6-4-2016 at 6:48 shortly before they close and spoke with a pharmacy tech, that argued with me that they gave me enough to last me until Tuesday of the next week then hung up on me. First, I'm a nurse. They filled a 90ml bottle with instruction "take one or two teaspoons every 8 hours." That's 3 doses in a 24 hour period now from Friday to Sun that's 90ml so no pain medicine on Monday or Tuesday. 10ml x 3 is 30ml x 3 days is 90ml.
*: I am new to Idaho, but not new to Wal-Mart. I NEVER had a problem in California. The first problem I had with pharmacy I phoned ahead. I waited in line, RX had to be reordered? When I saw it was done the gal kept helping other people making me wait again? This last time I asked how many refills I had; I don't care how long your techs work there. They are condescending. I don't know, maybe the content of my RX's lead them to draw conclusions? Very unprofessional! The snickering/etc is unbelievable!
*: My visit to the east Meadow Walmart pharmacy was horrible!!! The pharmacy manager on staff was so unprofessional and rude. After picking up new prescriptions we were asked by the cashier to have a consult. After waiting in line the manager came to the window asking if we had questions we said we did. He gave us a rude response to what the prescription was and insulted the purpose of the prescription in front of several other customers. There is a reason why the consult area is covered to protect one's privacy!! And instead of explaining the side effects or any interactions was very rude and dismissive. We love the pharmacists in this location but with a rude manager like that anyone would lose employees and customers!! Very upset this is the customer service a manager would provide to the general public with something as delicate as medications!!
*: The experience was horrible and should not be in a national chain like Wal-Mart. The disappointment is making me not want to go to Wal-Mart at all for anything. The pharmacy staff has a lot of lack of intelligence to say the least. I had a prescription for a blood sugar monitor that has been discontinued and has been replaced with another model. I asked the new replaced model. The item sells over the counter does not need a prescription. But because my insurance covers it I had it. The pharmacist insisted on me going back to my doctor which will take a $40.00 deductible and a wait of about two weeks to get the appointment for me to get a new prescription for a $19.99 monitor. I asked for the same monitor in the prescription and she said she will order it for me then she came back to say that Wal-Mart does not carry this monitor anymore. 
*: I have had issues when picking up rxs for family but only when involving CDs. Anytime it involved rxs for myself never ever a problem. Just because I have a 20 year association with 2 of the pharmacists doesn't mean they should violate moral and ethical standards they hold dear. I have never divulged this before but since pharmacy bashing seems to be THE IN THING TO DO I feel compelled to do so. Last year a weekend fill in rph who didn't know me from Adam was so empathetic. With my plight being 23.00 $ short for 5 new meds rxd for my mom he pulled the money from his wallet and made up the difference. I haven't yet seen him but I'll be certain to reimburse him for his KIND AND COMPASSIONATE ASSISTANCE.
*: The Walmart Pharmacy at Jordan Landing in West Jordan, Utah is not a good Walmart Pharmacy. I had a prescription transfer to them yet they refused to fill it because there was a date in parentheses that wasn't the same date as the fill date. Ok, I can understand that. This happened on a Saturday. Monday, I called my Dr to have them call the pharmacy to ok my prescription. I called the pharmacy to let them know I was waiting for my Dr's office to call them. While waiting, the pharmacy cancelled my prescription. I had to wait a few more hrs for the pharmacy to ok a new prescription. I do have to say, this is just the Walmart pharmacy at Jordan Landing. The Walmart pharmacy in South Jordan, Utah, on S Jordan Pkwy is excellent and very friendly.
*: Ok, so for anyone that's ever been injured and stuck on pain meds you literally know my pain when it comes to dealing with them (I was walking through the parking lot and hit by a truck and have had back problems ever since). I have been having the hardest time with these people. They will tell myself or my girlfriend that the medication will be ready within an hour or so; then when we drive all the way back to the store they tell us they couldn't fill it. Now I thought my prescribing doctor was in charge of when I should receive my medication not someone that counts pills all day. So I went through a time when the medication I was receiving wasn't enough. My doctor saw fit to change it and request that they fill the medication the same day due to the lack of effeteness the medicine had on me.
*: My husband is diabetic has his meds filled at a Walmart pharmacy. What a nightmare. Overcharged because Walmart sent the info to the insurance wrong. We had to call the insurance company to find that out. Told prescriptions would be ready in 48 hours, they never are. They are rude to their customers and they really don't care. After dealing with their half a-- service for the last year we are done. Have now transferred all our prescriptions to another pharmacy. Avoid the university ave pharmacy in St. Paul mn.
*: After properly signing into my Wal-Mart account, I select "Pharmacy Orders." I'm then taken to the "Online Pharmacy" login, whereupon I correctly enter my date-of-birth in the mm/dd/yyyy format. My browser is directed to the page that says "Recent Orders" and then the browser immediately brings up a page that says, "We are having trouble with your request. Please wait a moment and then try again." I've tried calling the 800-numbers provided by the local pharmacy, those provide at the website, and even the 800-numbers provided by Wal-Mart's help desk; now there is an oxymoron, "help desk." Once, they even said, "We will fix it. You don't need to call us." I've been trying intermittently for the last five (5) days to get this resolved, but to no avail. They can either fix it by the time I need the pharmacy again or I can see if my business is appreciated at a different company's pharmacy.
*: When trying to order a prescription from Wal-Mart home delivery the website keeps returning to STORE ORDER. Cannot review my prescriptions. Web page says "error not available". Will not renew Wal-Mart home delivery for prescriptions when my contract runs out. Wal-Mart likes to sell but no backup on problems.
*: My mother is scheduled for a colonoscopy and has to take a laxative in liquid form the day before the procedure. Her doctor called in the prescription six days ago. Today (on a weekend day) I went to pick it up and was told or was asked the following questions: 1) Had the doctor called it in at the last minute? (answer: no); 2) When was the procedure? (answer: in five days); 3) Could I call them in two more days to see if it was in by then?; 4) Could I return at that time to pick it up? If they had it because it is not in stock and is on backorder and has been for some time.
*: I am very sick and went to Walmart to get 2 prescriptions filled. For some reason ** cough syrup was not covered and they want $25 for a tiny bottle. The rude clerk had the nerve to tell me the RX cough syrup was the same as over-the-counter. I asked "Then why do I have to bring a signed controlled substance prescription?" I ended up going to E.R. the next day because of the prescription not being filled. The E.R. doctor wrote a prescription for a ** pill. The pharmacist looked at it and handed it back stating "We don't have this." I informed him he had a contract with my insurance company and their 50% refusal rate was not acceptable.
*: No matter which Walmart store I go to for filling prescriptions, the answer is always: NO!!! For some reason, they just don't want to fill prescriptions. They find every possible reason not to do so. Do they get paid for NOT filling prescriptions? The reasons are many: (for example) (a) prescription expired (when state rules state that prescriptions are valid for at least 6 months); (b) they don't take the discount card (when the discount card company clearly states that all Walmart and Sam's Stores take these cards); (c) they are out of stock (it does not matter what medication it is - they are always out of stock); (d) we only have one pharmacist working and it will take too long to fill (they are always short of staff - even on the busiest shopping days of the year, they don't have enough staff). It goes on and on and on like that.
*: Having worked in retail before I understand the purpose of many of the techniques used by the Sam's Corporation. As a consumer I often wonder when this giant chain will focus more on the customer vs. improving its horrible consumerism tactics. As I sit in Walmart waiting over 40 minutes for a prescription of 10 pills to be filled, I realize how tactical it is to tell all consumers erstwhile to wait unnecessary times to receive their prescriptions. However as I sit here with infection and fever of 101, I become even angrier with the lack of tact and care taken. 
*: I helped my mother refill 4 prescriptions and got 4 confirms emails that it went through. A couple weeks later, I find out that only two went through. I went in to pick up with my mom and to ask what happened. I was told by two employees that my moms medicare expired and that we passed the two week mark for pick up for the two processed. It made no sense. She was denied her meds that were done. I get home, called medicare and was told that everything is fine. I also went online to check the status of the refills and for some reason, 4 other meds are refilled. The following monday, I called Walmart and the person on the phone told me that everything is fine and it was all processed! 
*: Pharmacy at 6703 Leslie Road. This pharmacy and its employees are lazy and lie to your face. I have had scripts filled here for 4 years. Over the last year all you hear are excuses and lies. Last week called in refills 48 hours in advance was told they would be ready at 5 pm on Wed. Called before went up, they said we're ready. Arrived at 7 pm, my scripts weren't ready and wouldn't be until next day. These are very common scripts, no compounding or anything. For last year same excuse, we are short handed, or very busy. 
*: I refilled an existing prescription on January 20, 2016 - The pills were for my skin condition - kind of an anti itch pill. A week later my skin had broken out really bad - my sleeping pattern was severely altered. A friend of mine looked at the label and said "Randy, this is an anti depressant and it's very addictive." I took the bottle back to Walmart and they verified they had made a mistake and gave me the wrong pills. They kept the wrong ones and gave me the correct ones - no drama I was ok. 
*: I can remember at least for twice, I requested for refill and there was no medicine available. The first time, they notified me until I was in front of the desk to pick up my medicine. And their altitude is pretty bad, saying sorry with an facial expression and voice sounds like that was my fault. The second time, they left me a voice message. When I called them back, they are even impatient to hearing me explain why I called them back. They just told me that the medicine is not available without any apology. And the medicine will only available after 4 days!
*: As of 2 yrs ago, I am totally/physically disabled. I see a shrink, a psychotherapist, a urologist, a podiatrist, a rheumatologist, internal medicine doctor, a chiropractor, CDC doctors, a physical therapist and a nurse whom come to my home since I have to use Paratransit to travel with my walker. I am on approximately 15 different medications, and the list of maladies these treat is longer. All I do with my time is fight pain and go to see doctors who poke and prod me. I worked most of my adult life and raised two beautiful, responsible children who are now assets to society. I am on one narcotic pain medicine, which I refused at first because I was scared to take it. The pain beat into submission and I take it now, when the pharmacy has it in stock. It is hit and miss. 
*: I have used the new neighborhood Wal-mart pharmacy since they opened. It has been great to be able grab a few things & pick up my scripts at the same time. I have stage 4 Lupus & spinal disease. So after leaving my nerve blocks my son runs by, less stops mean less pain. Wrong, on Jan. 01, 2016 we dropped off my two scripts, same ones every month, same orders. It what allows me to be home w/ my kids, they allow me a little but needed relief of some of the pain. On this day it was a few days early for my **, but my ** was due, which controls muscle jerks. When we open the bag, I was shocked. Instead of 60 there was only 30! 
*: I went to Wal-Mart as doctor has sent prescription with my insurance details. The Wal-mart pharmacy slip says patient pay as $40. but the representative charged me $50. I have both Wal-mart pharmacy slip (40) as well as payment receipt (50). I asked the representative about it and person at counter said "It's typo error." This is totally wrong and wanted to know if it actually happens?
*: My son had a kidney stone crushed, removed and a stent put in. The doctor gave him a prescription and him several prescriptions and he had to wait 2 hours for his medicine to be filled. My husband has an elderly cousin that I pick up her medicine and I have been by the pharmacy every day after I get off work and it is still not ready. It may be ready today. I took care of a sick friend who had throat cancer and I had a terrible time with his medicine. Wal-Mart Pharmacy in Mullins is a mess. Unorganized and the personnel are not nice at all.
*: This pharmacy is the most unorganized and unconcerned place. My mother gets her RX filled here and they are never ready! Tired of their excuses. Tired of waiting! Tired of lies! Everyone that's waiting HATES THIS PHARMACY! Obviously, management needs to be replaced!
*: Every time that I go to Wal-Mart's Pharmacy, the associates on the clock are very snippy. I do understand that their job is stressful, considering the vast amount of customers that are unhappy about the cost/availability of their prescription. However, it is their job to be professional and courteous to each customer, and that is not distributed at the Johnstown, PA location. I had a prescription written by my PCP for **. I drove 20 minutes to our nearest Wal-Mart, where they told me they could not fill my prescription because my PCP forgot to sign the slip. Understandable. Instead of pointing out that my PCP forgot to sign off, the associate said "I CAN'T FILL THIS" and threw me the paper. "HE DIDN'T SIGN IT. THIS IS A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. I CAN'T FILL THIS" loud, and bold. Understood but she did not have to be rude. Also, would it hurt her to call my doctor to confirm the prescription? 
*: I have been filling my prescriptions at Walmart for as long as I can remember. They are always nice and willing to go above and beyond when needed. I was recently traveling and forgot a prescription I was taking at home. I called the nearest Walmart pharmacy at 7 pm on a Friday night asking if I could fill the script again that night, or if I can skip it for the weekend. The actual pharmacist for that location got on the phone with me, listened to exactly what was going on, and offered assistance. He researched the medicine extensively in order to give the best possible answer. He was willing to fill it for 3 days (out of pocket expense, filled it 5 days prior with insurance), but advised to just skipped the three days. He was extremely nice and helpful with the whole process. My advice, be nice to them, and they will be nice to you.
*: I have been on ** for several months and Wal-Mart is constantly out of stock. How can they always be out of stock on such an important product that is very high demand. Complaints to the store, pharmacy, district mgr fall on deaf ears. So I called Corp office and was assured someone would contact me but no one did. I have moved ALL of my families scripts to Walgreens.
*: Most disturbing about the Walmart pharmacy situation is that the pharmacy is NOT a part of the store's management structure. Complaints made to store management are wasted effort. I have been unable to discover any chain of responsibility within the company structure. I have been using Walmart pharmacy services for several years and have consistently had problems with prescriptions even though the pharmacists have changed. The store was recently renovated and procedures changed in that in order to drop off a prescription one must stand in the same line as those picking up prescriptions. What was a virtually instantaneous process now requires as much as thirty minutes. Of course, more time in line is required to pick up the the completed order.
*: I have been filling the same prescription at Walmart for at least 2 years. There seems to be a problem almost every month. Frequently, they are out of the medication and have no way to get it in for several days - a medication that is not supposed to be stopped abruptly. Additionally, the customer is not contacted to let them know if there is a problem - until they show up to pick up their medication. One month, an employee had neglected to put in a diagnostic code so the Rx was not filled. On questioning I found, there is no system that alerts them they have left out required information - it is not discovered until... you guessed it... the customer shows up and no Rx ready. So, no inventory controls and no quality controls. Transferred my Rx.
*: Switched to the Walmart pharmacy about 10 days ago. Notice now that my ** is no longer working resulting in extreme agitation, depression, anxiety. Went to pharmacy and asked them why the drugs they get from Pakistan don't work. They don't care. After I became upset they transferred the prescription to a Rite Aid where they get their drugs from Canada. I have experienced the same thing with previous ** refills in the past
*: I had a defective inhaler and I was suffering from asthmatic symptoms. The pharmacy assistant was some young girl. She did not even care that I was sick. She offered no assistance. The pharmacist as well said to call the manufacturer GSK for a new inhaler. It was over the weekend so I suffered all the weekend with breathing difficulties. Nobody cared that it could be a life or death situation. I will never use this pharmacy again and will shop less at Walmart.
*: No matter how many times I call to check to make sure my rx is ready, this pharmacy never had it ready. I have even received a text saying it was ready, came 20 min later and had to wait 30 min for it. On top of that the staff is rude, disrespectful and unhelpful.
*: The pharmacy did call me back and resolved the problem, by refunding me the amount paid along with crediting me $5 on a gift card. So everything worked out after all.
*: I was notified on Thursday that I had 2 prescription refills ready at my local Walmart (20 miles from my home). Today, Monday, I came to pick them up. It was already reshelved and now I am having to wait at least 30 minutes. Not happy.
*: No call to alert me 3 weeks post order. Pkg returned undeliverable. I called Wednesday. Staff transposed address yet refused to credit back meds returned. Closed Saturday. One month out I still cannot actually get meds locally due to Walmart order still showing Rx X 2 sent. Still outstanding visa charges for drugs not delivered. Incompetent.
*: Tried to fill my mom's prescription - it was a comedy of errors, to describe it lightly. The doctor ordered a quantity of 30 with six refills on 9 scripts. Pharmacist explained that she couldn't get a 90 day supply because that's not what was prescribed. I called the doctor and he called and spoke to the pharmacist. I later called to confirm the conversation with the pharmacist and was told the issue had been rectified and she could be prescribed a 90 day supply for her meds. 
*: My doctor faxed in my 2 prescriptions about 3 pm in the afternoon. I went to 1700 SOUTH ORANGE BLOSSOM TRAIL, APOPKA, FLORIDA 32703 to pick up my prescriptions at 6:45 pm. They said they didn't have anything for me. I said it was faxed in about 3pm. They looked on their fax machine and it was never removed. Then they said I'd have to wait another hour. I said I'll come in tomorrow morning and pick it up. The next day, I went in at 12 noon. They hadn't filled it yet! They said I'd have to wait 30 minutes. These were just pills, one was prepacked. Never apologized for the inconvenience. Said, "this is the way we do things".
*: Walmart pharmacy Sierra Vista, AZ weekend employee yelled at me, asking questions about the differences between prescribed medicine and over-the-counter one. The weekend manager and other techs were giggling at me. They were all rude and unkind. It happened Nov 1, 2015 in the afternoon. I reported it to Walmart Corporate Office.
*: The cashier refused to check me out. Stated they only can check out 6 items. I had 20 and most needed the gun and not bagged and I didnt see a sign that states anything but waited 20 minutes there 30 up front and there was no one behind me. Vernon, TX.
*: The Wal-Mart pharmacy in El Dorado, Kansas advertises that they are open on Sundays but when I would go to their pharmacy on Sunday the pharmacy would be locked up and no one would be there. I would ask Wal-Mart employees if the pharmacy was open and they would tell me that it was open and when I would ask why the pharmacy was locked up with nobody working there they would say that they didn't know. It happened to me 3 different times before I had enough and started going to Walgreens. I know Walgreens is not open on Sundays but at least they don't advertise that they are open. I'll never use Wal-Mart pharmacy again.
*: Today November 2nd I went to the Roseville Walmart. The new one they build after they closed down the silver lake building. I hate it. I went to get a prescription filled and as I was speaking to the pharmacy tech the manager comes over and says "can you be quiet because you're causing me not to be able to focus on my work" when all I was doing was asking the tech why is my insurance being denied. How dare this grown women speak to a customer when her job is to be a professional? If she seen me needing some help and the tech wasn't helpful she should of came over there and helped instead of her saying that mess to me. I have been a loyal customer to Walmart so after I told the lady off and ask what is kinda manager are she kept staring at the tech and they started laughing. She then walks away and says "I'll just transfer it to another pharmacy" with a attitude as if I did something to her.
*: I'm not sure what this pharmacy's objective is when it comes to their customers, but if they are being paid to be rude and inconsiderate to their customers then at least we can say they're doing their job. The pharmacists do not care enough to answer simple questions about over the counter medications or anything for that matter and the technicians are just following the leader. One of the techs, Monique, literally told me she couldn't get my prescription ready in a reasonable amount of time because she "has other things to do this morning". I'm standing up here now waiting and she is the rudest person I've ever known, that's not even coming from a professional perspective. She should not be in the field of helping people. This pharmacy needs a major slap in the face!
*: The Walmart at Clearbrook, Roanoke, VA has continuously failed to provide acceptable service. It's one thing after another! There have been so many issues but the one below is a brief account of the latest AND the last occurrence of less than mediocre service (the polite/classy version). They never requested my refill from physician after requesting it three times. Then I found out they did request it, just under the wrong name... and filled it! 
*: Well, I'm pregnant with my first child and I'm extremely sick, vomiting a lot. My ob-gyn prescribed me ** bec it's the only thing that works for me. When I ran out this time, for some reason, my insurance wouldn't cover it until the following Saturday. The pharmacy tech told me that he could give me 3 pills to get me through and then I can come back on Saturday to pick up the rest. I came back on Saturday only to find they would only give me three pills again! I asked why and they said that's all my prescription would cover, even after I've been given 30 pills at a time for the last 3 months. Turns out the tech permanently changed my prescription to 3 pills at a time, so now I have to go back to WalMart and pay 10 bucks every other day as opposed to the normal 10 bucks for 30 pills every 15 days. I'm changing my pharmacy and my prescription back as soon as I can. Thanks WalMart!!
*: These know it all mother ** nerd pharmacists gave me such a hard time filling my prescription for ** after it turned out I was breaking out in hives from the ** first prescribed which they only filled half of 45 out of 90. After several phone calls. Back and forth between Tulare Wal-Mart pharmacy and several phone calls from them to my doctor and my doctor to them and my doctor office to me and my doctors office back to them three days later I had my script. Mind you I've just been released from the hospital with three fractures in my pelvis and one through my tailbone and these nerds are treating me like a drug addict.
*: I was told that on a Friday after 5 the doctor would need to approve my ** refill. The pharmacist would not allow for a partial refill since it was not life threatening. As I tried to explain to the beautiful but misinformed pharmacist if you have ever suffered from ** withdrawal it's pretty darn close. If I'd of used CVS I think I would have had a different response. Never using Walmart pharmacy again.
*: My Doctor's office accidentallly called my prescription into the Bleachery Blvd Walmart pharmacy by mistake on Saturday, October 24, 2015. Later in the day I received a call saying they did not have medication to fill the prescription but could give me a partial prescription and medication, would be there on Tuesday. About an hour later they called to say they had none in stock, but that it would be here on Tuesday. When I went on Tuesday, the lady (I hate to call her a pharmacy tech because that would be an insult to them) said, "do we have your current number because someone should have called you to let you know that the prescription could not be filled." I said, "someone did call and said it would be ready for pick up today."
*: My physician emailed a request for a nasal spray and stated to apply nasally. The pharmacist refused to send it for approval to my insurance company because it did not state RIGHT OR LEFT NOSTRIL!! It was to be used for BOTH!! What an unprofessional idiot that didn't want to work at 8:15 PM. Let the insurance company deny it and I would berate them. But she smugly stated she would not even submit it to them as it was incorrectly written. Shameful. I am changing insurance companies so I don't have to go to Walmart next year. I can CHANGE Walmart. You're not the only show.
*: Anytime I come here it's always over an hour to get anything filled. There is 8 employees working, 6 of which are just talking and having a good old time back there like no one has anywhere to be. I'm done with this place. I'm going to Target from now on.
*: I had been with the Pendleton Wal-mart Pharmacy before and changed to another pharmacy because of them not having the medications on hand. I would have to wait up to 2 days before they could fill it, or they would send me to another pharmacy to get it filled. This year my insurance said that I needed to go to certain pharmacies to get the best price. I could of went to Safeway or Wal-mart, I gave Wal-mart a second chance. I had all of my mothers, grandson and my prescriptions filled just before we moved back to Wal-mart. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! I take a pain patch. When it was time to refill it and my grandsons prescription I was told "We don't have any", "It will take a week and a half to get some". I went back to the one I left Wal-mart for the first time. They had a month to get in the meds my family takes and they was STILL OUT even with the month notice.
*: Several times when the pharmacists tend to not follow up on getting authorizations for refills from the doctors. They depend on the faxing of the information which causes a problem when I have waited more than 3 days for the resolution. My wife gets her medication from the Walmart Pharmacy on Liberia Avenue in Manassas, VA and she gets authorization from her doctors for refills with no problems 100 percent without her intervention. Matter-of-fact, she refuses to put any of her medications at the Woodbridge Walmart because of what I explained. My suggestion is that a policy change is necessary. Faxing does not work all the time. Put an associate to follow-up by phone to keep the customers reasonably satisfied. I believe that what service is all about.
*: Dropped off RX. Vicky who works there asked for my license, gave it to her. She asked me to sign, I asked where, she threw the pen at me and said, "Here". I said, "Sorry, I didn't hear where you said." She rolled her eyes. I said, "You are rude." She replied, "You are rude" and then when I asked to speak to a manager, she pointed over there and then talked about me to the RPH and I heard everything she said about me. Store manager came and was very helpful and stated he would take care of it. I can't believe someone who deals with the public and pts all day hates their job so much that they can actually be so rude to them. I will be pulling all my RX and my families and never want to do business with Walmart again.
*: My husband and I get several prescriptions filled at Walmart in Romeoville, IL. monthly. I have a prescription for ** to refill on a monthly basis. EVERY MONTH they never have it in stock when my refill is due. I sometimes have to miss a dose or two waiting on my prescription to be refilled. This pharmacy needs to order more of this medicine if they have a large number of people that use it. This needs to be looked into immediately as this service is subpar.
*: I will not use this pharmacy ever again.. They won't fill my prescription as Dr ordered.. I will be using a different pharmacy as my Dr said they have half a brain.. and very rude people..
*: My son's prescriptions were sent by his dr hours ago and I get here to find out they're still not ready hours later. Employees let me know they put in store people first and mine are not ready yet... Wasting my time - priceless. Thanks!
*: North University St. Peoria, IL. - I have been dealing with numerous health issues since early December of last year. My experience with this particular pharmacy has been nothing but wonderful. They are always so nice to me, are extremely courteous, and have really looked out for me. Unfortunately I am currently taking five different medications, but I look forward to seeing my "friends" at the pharmacy.
*: On October 8th, I went to fill my prescription. Of course I was two days early. They said they would keep the written prescription, then I would need to call it in that Sunday. 1 day past the due date. I asked for the prescription back to take them to another pharmacy. Why? Because the month before they shorted me 15 pills. They gave me back the written prescription with writing and stickers on them. That said, I didn't feel comfortable taking them to another pharmacy with notes on them along with half torn off stickers. So, I went back to pick up the prescription, and was drilled as to what happened. I explained also adding the prescription they were filling was one day late. The pharmacist stated it wasn't and I pointed out the dates. He mumbled and became quite agitated. So, I waited patiently, they called me, I asked them to recount the prescription, they refused and stated they had already been coated twice.
*: This pharmacy will fill your whole prescription (including all your refills) at one time without consulting you first. This practice means more money out of pocket for you, and more revenue for Walmart. I should have a choice rather I want a 30-day supply... $4 or 180 day supply... $20, then the staff including the pharmacist withhold the real reason you're paying more. SHAME ON WALMART!
*: My four year old son had a very serious asthma attack last night that landed us inside the ER. After the doctors got his breathing under control, and my son was able to speak again, and after some monitoring we were discharged. We were given two prescriptions. The first prescription was **, in which we had some at home already that would get us through the night. The second prescription was a steroid by mouth, **, which we did NOT have any at home. We were released from the ER in the evening and were told to go to the Walmart pharmacy as they closed at 9 pm.
*: Every time we have gone in Walmart Pharmacy, there is a line all back down the aisle. They do not even acknowledge that all these people are standing there waiting on some assistance, They do not even look up and say we will be right with you or anything. Then someone in line may say, "can you please get another person to help?" They still do not say anything. We just stand there anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes. Then when you get waited on, the person that waits on you is rude and unprofessional. Will not say "how are you", "sorry for your wait", or "thank you" after transaction. This occurs ALL THE TIME. We are the customers and I think we all deserve to be treated better than this.
*: I saw an elderly gentleman being berated by the pharmacist today. Walmart on Trooper Rd in Morristown, PA. The guy had filled out a form to get a flu shot and he did not have his reading glasses with him. He signed below the lines but he still signed. The pharmacist was rude and berating to him and then threw him out of the store. He was not allowed to get a flu shot.
*: Ever since the pharmacy changed its phone computer system, I can't get them to notify me when my prescriptions are ready for pickup. I have talked to the staff and they have requested this to be done. However, they say it's a glitch in the system. This is since the first of the year. Please fix your system.
*: My Dr gave one prescription that I took in the same day, since they always take long. I ask my husband to pick prescription and a refill requested. When I look into the bag of prescriptions, I had it the 2 refills and none of those were the new prescription. That's okay, I said to myself, so I call Wal-mart Pharmacy. Lady told me that probably the doctor make a mistake. So I personally went to my Dr. They had show me that the mistake occurred at the pharmacy. What it really got frustrates and disappointed was that they lie to me, trying to cover up their mistake. The Dr. office had it to submit a new one thru the internet a week after the incident.
*: Sick people beware! In 2013 I had surgery for cancer and started chemo. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure at the same time and in May 2014 and again in August they filled the script for 75 pills rather than 90 days. I was sick from chemo (chemo brain) and wrecked by not knowing if I'd even be alive by the end of the year. I was new to prescriptions (I had never had a regular prescription before). The next time my prescription came up I caught it and saw they pointed out that the prescription said 90 days hadn't it? And lo and behold the fill clerk muttered she didn't know how the system would accept 75.
*: I went to the store to fill a prescription and the place didn't have enough in stock so I got a little bit shy of half. I was told that the lady manager at the pharmacy was a ** so come on another day. I returned the day the person told me to go 4 days after??? They wouldn't fill the prescription! She said the insurance wouldn't pay for it until 9 days longer? I filled the same thing the month before at a different place and there wasn't an issue like that! After calling the insurance company the people at Walmart lied!!! I was livid! The whole town of Seabrook is filled with trife inbreed scum and going there you see it all. I'm taking this situation to another level and make sure they don't lie to another customer. Believe me!
*: I have been waiting for my blood pressure meds to be refilled for over a week. It's not just a single store but all of the Walmart pharmacies in town seem to diametrically opposed to friendly service. I have literally seen associates laughing and smiling among themselves and instantly switch to a frown and sour look as they approach the counter. My insurance provides free Tier 1 prescription refills at preferred partner, Wal-Mart, so I have been stuck with them for a year. 
*: I have had problems with the Walmart pharmacy from the beginning. They cannot fill a prescription within a reasonable time. I have finally given up. I submitted a prescription towards the middle to the end of August and as of 09/11 my prescription still has not been filled and they won't give me a solid date as to when it will be filled. I'm picking up my doctor's prescription from them and going elsewhere. I will NOT be going back!!!
*: I have used Walmart Santee pharmacy 3 times now. I pay out of pocket and cost is the primary reason. No more. Every time I go to fill they say 1 hour. And after waiting they either don't have the medicine or today after going over the script at drop off they don't understand it. The doctor is now gone and this is a medication that must be taken everyday. I have none on hand because they can't fill early. It's always rude, nasty employees who treat you like crap. I am done with Walmart. I'll pay more or use Costco.
*: I went to Walmarts Pharmacy located at Mayaguez Mall Shopping Center to buy an important medicine for my aunt, on Saturday 5, 2015 at 12:30 PM. I was glad because there was only 1 person before me. The lady had a piece of paper written by hand that said: "CLOSED FROM 1:30 - 2:00". She told me to go back later after 2:00. I asked why, because it was almost empty, and it was 12:31 and the paper said "Closed from 1:30". It was almost an hour, and all I wanted to know was if they have the medication and more or less the price because it was cash. 
*: I sat for over an hour for my prescription and then was told it could be at least another half hour. They were NOT that busy. I walked away WITHOUT my prescription and now have to make another 30 min drive tomorrow to pick it up. I will never use Wal-Mart pharmacy again, your workers stood around talking while people were waiting to be helped. It was like this years ago and never changed. Only reason I went there today was because my pharmacy was closed for the labor day holiday. Get better help, update your equipment, maybe you stop losing customers. Thank you.
*: I took a prescription to Wal-Mart and I was told the wait time was 60 minutes, which is double the usual wait time. I need the medicine so I decided I would wait and pick up a few things. I saw that the man in front of me on a cane was told that he had to have pharmacist counsel him about his prescription. He said "I do not want counseling, I have been taking this prescription for years." They would not give him his medicine until the pharmacist came and talked to him about the prescription. The cashier said it was a new Wal-Mart policy. Then he had to sign that he had received the counseling. Are they billing for providing counseling by the pharmacist and making it mandatory? 
*: I was going to my Walmart in Concordia, KS to get my new prescriptions filled. I had the scripts in had from the college MSN, APRN, FNP-C. I went up the counter, told them that I would like to have these filled. She asked who wrote the scripts and I told her it was the college Family Practice APRN. She started scrolling through her system. She said "Did your school Health Counselor contact us in any form?" I said, "I don't think so" I think that is why she handed me the scripts. "Okay, well because you are from a college, we have to have 2 forms of confirmation. One in script form, and another by phone, fax, email etc." 
*: On August 22nd 2015, I call the pharmacy to a have a ** prescription filled. I actually went to the store on August 31st to pick it up. When I arrived they told me they had restocked it and would fill it again. After getting the prescription and going back to work I opened it up and found that 30 of the sixty pills were missing. I called the pharmacy immediately and spoke with the pharmacist. She told me knew the person who filled my prescription and they had counted their pills and all was well and I was wrong. I ask them to look at their security cameras and was told she could not. Something is rotten here. I was to receive 60 pills and only got 30. I called Walmart customer service and they said this is serious and would investigate and I would get my medication. Time will tell and I will report what the outcome of this is.
*: Walmart pharmacy in Patterson CA, held my prescription for about 2 weeks and when I went to pick up my prescription they just refused to fill for no apparent reason. I have my doctor's phone number and the clinic I go to is local. I want to know why they did this to me. Why didn't they just tell me when I dropped it off. I will get all my family members to stop using this pharmacy. The lady is nothing but rude to me and just threw my prescription back and walked away not giving me a reason. Like I said earlier if something seems suspicious my doctor's information was right on the prescription. I am very disappointed and angry at this person that was nothing but rude not knowing my medical reasons. I want an explanation.
*: Can anyone tell me what to do to get help with the run around with the pharmacy? They are constantly out of multiple medications. Who is in charge for such a poorly-ran area of need? They make me want to give up on medical care. :(
*: I took my prescription into this horrible Walmart pharmacy. They had two people taking in prescriptions and there was no privacy at the drop off window. I was told it would be ready later. I said “Ok. Can you text me when it's finished?” She said if it's in the system Which it was so. After I looked around the store I got a text and headed over to pharmacy with ice cream in my cart and all. I was up next to get my daughter’s pills. Guess what happened. The pharmacist filled capsules when the pills say tablets only and I was supposed to cut each pill and give my daughter them this way, doctor’s orders. I asked why are these capsules I have never had them this way. He said “Well if you have a problem take it up with the medicine discount card place.” I said “What?” He said “I'm not giving you tablets.” I got the prescription back and left. 
*: We were given the 800 phone number to Walmart Specialty Pharmacy by the Pharmacist at Supercenter in Walmart in Branson, MO, because the local Walmart did not have the drug **. When we contacted the Specialty Pharmacy, they told us to go back to Walmart Supercenter in Branson and have them enter information in their computer so Specialty Pharmacy that Walmart owns, they can fill this prescription. My question is why hasn't the manager over Walmart pharmacies trained their employees how to do this? The customer shouldn't be the one that has to inform their pharmacist the proper procedures to follow. Walmart is starting to fall apart from within. Too bad Mr. Walton is not here to straighten their customer service out.
*: I had my ** refilled on 5/29/2015. The refill was for 90 days. I take one tablet at bedtime. My pills ran out on the 16th of August. I keep my pills in a place where no one can get to them. I called Walmart and told them I was short pills. They said I will have to wait until August 26 to get a refill. So have to go 10 days without my pills.
*: Was short 5 ** pills. They gave them to me. Now I count them while they watch. Not the first time that it happened. Why?
*: My bones in my arm were basically completely shattered in bicycle accident. Being held together by steel rods. I was having problems and confusion with my insurance company and knowledge of what pain medication I was supposed to take. I was in extreme pain. My doctor prescribed me a couple of different pain meds and I didn't fill either due to the fact that I was having problems getting to the pharmacy. When I finally was able to get down there, I was quite relieved because my sleeping had been terrible and every time I moved my broken arm it is like an electrical shock from hell. I took the prescriptions up to the counter at the Walmart Pharmacy in Laguna Niguel, CA. My arm is bandaged and in a sling. I gave the guy at the counter both prescriptions and at first he told me he could only fill one and which one did I want. I had no idea because I have never taken either before and I didn't know the difference.
*: I asked to pharmacist to transfer my prescriptions to another pharmacy since I have changed insurances and my meds are covered under another pharmacy. The pharmacist said that it was against Wal-Mart's policy to transfer prescriptions. She then said that they would put her on hold and she didn't have time to do it and it wasn't her job to do it anyway. So which one is it? Is it you can't do it or that you don't want to do it? 
*: No consequences yet. I'm not stopping until I get to the bottom of what the problem is they have with me! My meds or my 7-spine surgeries. One tech is Heather. No problems. Follows directions, never bends rules. Now the other person, I won't share his name, has acted like god. I've been texted that my medications filled with an oint that ins paying. I go to get and get third degree. It's their text to me! Then I question it and all of a sudden, they are out. 
*: They constantly don't have drugs in stock, saying they will be ordered, they never come in at the time they say they will. The website doesn't work or is offline most of the time. They tell you they will text your phone when the drugs are in, yet once again, they never do. Is there any oversight of these pharmacies?
*: Again for the third month I called a refill via the so called electronic refill system in to WM pharmacy in Canon City, CO. I live an hour away so it's a trek for me to go down the mountain to pick up scripts, so I called today to make sure my scripts were filled prior to heading down and again I'm told "no refill request was made". I see an NP as my primary physician and he has an overseeing licensed physician, whose name is on my file at WM and he has authorized my meds for over a year. The last three months, even though I call the refill in a week prior to the refill date I'm told it was a different doctor who sent in the refill authorization so they couldn't fill my script till they cleared up the issue with the name. It's the only licensed physician at the medical clinic and all my scripts have been filled under that doctor. 
*: Ever since October of 2014 I have had monthly non-stop problems with Walmart. This month, Aug 2015 I am finally done with this company. They can never keep my records straight. They never pull up my manufacturers' coupons with my meds and get this. THIS month my insurance shows it was cancelled in April of 2015 when the pharmacy clearly can see I used it last month according to even their own records. I asked how much my two scripts would be cash... 588.00 when the coupons stated they wouldn't be over 65.00... go figure. Either they have some real incompetent idiots working at Walmart Creston store or they just don't give a ** anymore. Call into my Shopko pharmacy... wow no problems there. Seems my health insurance isn't cancelled after all... What morons.
*: I am almost 64 yrs old and Kemah pharmacy lied to me about when they would have my medication which I could die if I do not take. They sent me to La Marque, Texas and said pick it up. I got disrespected and really got mad because I got disrespected and lied to. I had to run around in 110 degree temps with humidity and got treated like a drug addict by two Hispanic women in particular. I was dizzy in one Walmart because of back and neck injuries and heat from the truck I told them no ac in it.. I was so upset I was shaking and had heart pains from the heat. They cancelled my meds and my doctor said that was a good prescription and should have been refilled. I ran around for 7 hrs to get this med filled because of Walmart pharmacy. They cancelled my med out and my doctor's office called it back in and the Kemah pharmacy told her they basically did not know when my medication would be in.
*: I have been using Wal-Mart pharmacy for the last 3 years. They are always out of my medication. First a few months ago they lost my seizure medication prescription. A lot of times they are out of my meds. On July 31st I had a prescription to be filled. They only filled me enough to last 3 days. 3 days later they still didn't have my medication. I was off my medication for 2 days. I went into the pharmacy to ask them what was going on. The pharmacist was very rude. I ended up having to go back to my doctor for another prescription and had it filled at CVS. I have now had all my prescriptions transfers to CVS. I will never use Wal-Mart pharmacy again.
*: Now that I went to pick up my refill which I called in this morning, it was NOT ready for pick up so they were scrambling to dispense them. They shorted me AGAIN. I have never had a seamless experience with any of the Wal-Mart Pharmacy. This was my last refill and my last time going there. Horrible service.
*: Every time I have gone to any Walmart pharmacy, not only are they rude and make me feel like it's an inconvenience to them to fill my prescriptions but they can't ever get it straight. I have been shorted and had to rectify this myself, and not only when they had it ready to pick up they still did not contact me to inform me. They had also been refilling ** (which I found out they aren't allowed to do) the last time they decided to follow procedures, they never told me. I found on my bottle it said 0 refills so I asked them. When they told me they can't refill ** I said "can you call the doctor?" They said "well only if he accepts faxes," I said "yes, he does." 
*: Got discharged from hospital after open heart surgery on 7/14/15. Had to get 8 prescriptions filled at Walmart pharmacy, Pascagoula, MS. 1 prescription was wrong and I took it for 8 days until I had to have it refilled on 7/22/15. At that time they caught their mistake and corrected it with the right medication added to it. All my wife got from the pharmacy was "we sorry."
*: WalMart Pharmacy in Grants, NM - This particular pharmacy took over a week to get a diabetes medication for my husband. When it finally arrived I was told to give them an hour to fill the rx. Four hours later I am sitting here still waiting! This is typical service for this particular pharmacy!
*: I have been using your local Wal-Mart pharmacy since it opened many years ago. They have always treated us fairly and with respect and dignity. They have gone out of their way to find prescription medicines at better prices from different companies and have transferred all of our prescriptions to other Wal-Mart pharmacies when we leave for our 3 month "snowbird" vacations to Sarasota, Florida. When they believe our prescriptions may have been written incorrectly or at an improper dose they have informed us and have called our physicians to discuss their concerns, often resulting in corrected dosages or type of medication. In spite of the huge volumes of drugs that they process each day we are treated as valuable customers each time we pick up our meds. We could not be happier with any other pharmacy.
*: I had damaged prescriptions and called my DR. to find how to fix this. Well I was told to take this fax and the scripts to the pharm and they would call and get them verified. Well not only did they not call I was getting deodorant an aisle over and heard them saying things like "junkie tryin' to pull one over," then I waited until they said leave. Never heard back from them and I call up there well after DR. hours and they said "you have to go and get new ones from your DR." - knowing that I could not reach her at that time. I'm bipolar, schizo, ADHD, have borderline personality disorder, PTSD. They don't want me to go without one pill of any meds I'm on. If I were to lose it falls on you so you lost a lot business from my family.
*: On numerous occasions I have had to be a strong advocate for myself because of the problems at this location. Some staff just do not know what is going on and when you explain it to them they still do not get it. Imagine being an elderly person dependent on others to do the right thing. My suggestion would be to reevaluate the process and customer service within this department. If you need more details you can contact me and just request then I will be happy to share. Poor business when it comes to medications.
*: Every time I went to pick up my scripts, I had to remind them of my discount cards, they try to tell me they are outdated but never are. They are terrible, I can't recall the times I have gone there to find my scripts were not available after being told they were done. Finally had enough, I switched to a pharmacy that has wonderful workers and do everything possible to save you money, even taking the time to see if any coupons available... without me asking.
*: I called in as usual to have my scripts filled. Right on time like always every month. When I called to make sure that they were ready the lady told me that my **'s couldn't be filled until the 18th because that's what is written on the script. Ok I understand that, but I told her "I picked them up last month on the 16th of June ok." Then she said that there was another 1 that they were out of stock. "So wait just a second," I said. "Ma'am can I speak with your manager?" She said "yes but it's going to be a very long time." I said "I will wait." When Glen finally came on line I asked him about my **'s and why they can't be filled. He said "because the paper script says the 18th". 
*: I quit shopping at the Mount Vernon, Washington Walmart because of the poor treatment of customers. I use to use their pharmacy. I took a prescription in to be filled and they told me it would be a 20 minute wait so I waited and then went to check to see if it was ready then they told me it would be another 20 minutes. Checked again and they said, "Sorry, we don't have that brand". Now why didn't they check when I first went there to see if they had that particular brand? Also they discriminated against handicapped people all the time. I have witnessed that myself. Corporate headquarters needs to shake things up in that store. Maybe the employees don't get paid enough but that is no reason to treat people the way that they do. 
*: Every time my mom's prescription for ** is sent here they never have it in stock.
*: I am currently taking ** and I dropped my prescription off and was told it would be "hours" before it was ready, so I called and told them I would be dropping off a prescription and they then told me 45m. Clearly I was told "hours" due to the nature of the script. My husband is on 100mg ** and 800mg ** for his seizures. Walmart pharmacy would fill his script because of his **, there nothing illegal about that, but the pharmacist said they was calling his Drs. My mother is also on ** and prior to her treatment she was prescribed **... SHE DID NOT GET ** within 30d. The pharmacist told her she couldn't receive ** period due to having a prior ** script. AND NOW WALMART HAS CALLED MY HUSBAND DR AND THEY CANCELED HIS ** HIS SEIZURE MEDICINE DUE TO THE ** BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT MEDICINE!
*: Yesterday I had made a complaint on an incident at the store. First thing this morning, I received a call from a marketing manager who manages the above location and all I can say is, WOW! The level of professionalism, in which this gentlemen handled my concerns speaks volumes! I truly am speechless and pleased. Walmart definitely has an elite Manager handling incidents. The employee whom, I had reported on my complaint, called me personally and couldn't have been more genuine and apologetic, and I accepted her apology. I am extremely pleased with the urgency shown to address a customer's concerns, and time frame in addressing my complaint was exceptional. Walmart, keep your Marketing Manager happy! He is a GEM!
*: On June 5th 2015 I went to my local walmart pharmacy and I've been using them for years now, same scripts, same doctors and to get pick up my scripts. Well on the 24th of every month I pick up ** 10 and on the 3rd of every month I pick up ** 7.5. I had back surgery and I use these 2 pain meds to help with my pain and now I was told I'm a drug addict by the pharmacist which I was numb when I heard that... I was told that they will not fill my meds unless I bring 1 of them back. They been given me my meds from day 1 and now they are pulling this. I'm in so much pain that I'm doubling up on my meds to make me somewhat comfy... I have foot drop on a walker back brace. I'm in so much pain that I need these meds. My PCP just don't write me a script if I have pills left. I get my meds every month. Just slander is enough so what can we do about this.
*: Tried to refill my prescriptions on 6/23/15. Never received. Reordered on 6/30/15. Complete ineptness and rudeness of Jess, the supervisor. Wal-Mart is squeezing every last dime out of anyone they can.
*: Walmart, Connecticut Ave, Norwalk, CT - Pharmacy staff is surly and contemptible refusing to follow through on a simple request to take a moment to verify my existing insurance. It was too much work for them. On the afternoon of Friday Jul 3rd I arrived to pick up my prescription that normally costs $6.60. I was asked to pay $447.00, this stunned me. When I protested and asked the pharmacist to verify my insurance coverage, she refused. Her excuse was "Jan 1st you changed insurance companies." The new one AARP, the largest, with the most leverage of any drug insurer, didn't cover this commonly used drug. I protested feeling her excuse was a way to get out of taking an extra step. The response was either I could pay or go home.
*: I bought my prescribed ** from Walmart after my Doctor prescribed to me. And after applying it on my face it turned allergic. And I had to go to urgent care because my face was very swollen and I had swollen gland. The Doctor advised me to stop using it and she gave me a steroid shot to stop the allergic effects. I called Walmart to check if I can return the ** and they refused to take back. This is so unfair since I spent 114.70 that told me that this was not covered on my insurance so I had to pay cash. They need to pack a small amount so we don't have spend too much. I wish I had shopped at CVS. They take back any prescription opened/unopened.
*: Walmart demands I pay a co-pay even though I have part B medical co-pay insurance. Then, when Medicare and secondary pay Walmart refuses to refund my personnel payments. Store I'm having problem with refuses to let me speak to store manager. March 2015 requested transfer of Rx to Walgreens. Walmart did not honored that request. Had to call my physician for a new Rx. Three months and Walmart has yet transfer any of my prescriptions. Six months and Walmart has not refunded private payments or acknowledge there is a credit on my account.
*: Went to Walmart to get some insulin for my dog and the woman gave me the wrong insulin. Looked the same but one is a ** and the other **. Idiot could have killed my dog.
*: Our Wal-Mart here in Burgaw, NC opened up a little over a month ago. The grand opening day I went over and filled out the information to transfer my prescription from Wilmington, NC Pharmacy that was 33 miles away from my home as Burgaw, NC Wal-mart pharmacy is only 2 miles from my home. Around 3 days after filing my paperwork to transfer my prescriptions,  I called in my prescriptions and went to pick them up the next day and they had totally lost them. No record of them. It took all day to get it straightened out, but I thought, "Oh well, this is their first week." 
*: I went to pick up my dog's prescription and as always the staff starts off on the unfriendly side. There was one person in front of me and no one behind me. When I stepped up to the counter I was given one of the two items I came for and when I requested my dog's other one they had a question that they needed answered. As I didn't know the answer offhand they told me they were going to close for lunch and I'd have to come back in a half hour. I told them that I was going to call my pup's vet and I'd get them this information right there and then. I was on the phone with them for a minute and they again told me they were closing for lunch. As I was just about to give them the info they needed, I told them I wasn't leaving and as they already started with my purchase without mention of their impending close I was going to finalize my purchase. 
*: Walmart - Store 2538 Green Acres, Eugene, OR. I just went through the worst experiences in retail to date. To make a long story as short as possible; I have tried to refill ** for my breathing due to tumors on my spine. First dropped off the request 6-13, the female at the counter stated "don't you realize we close at 7 pm", it was 6:22? She didn't want to be bothered? Then left the request to pick up. 2 days later 6-15 find out it hasn't been done. Two days later 6-18 go in to pick it up, by this point I am completely out just to be told by the pharmacist ** they don't have the order and what do I want him to say, it's not his problem and "go to the hospital if you can't breathe." "REALLY." He asked what my problems was after several times of trying to explain what has happened without him wanting to listen. I stated at the moment "my problem is you being an '**'. I just need to figure out why after a week I still don't have my meds." 
*: So today is Friday June 19, 2015 and I dropped off my prescriptions at the Walmart pharmacy in Selma, CA on Monday June 15. I went in today to check on when I might be able to pick up my prescriptions. I gave them my name and DOB and they said they had nothing on file for me (I use two different last names, so it can be a little confusing) and so I asked about my mother's prescriptions which I had dropped off on the same day and they said they also don't have anything on file for her. At this point I was getting very upset because my pain management doctor is a 4 hour drive from my home and I would not be able to get new prescriptions easily if the pharmacy had lost them. 
*: My pharmacy is the best because they always ask if I need to speak to the pharmacist which I don't - I speak with my doctor but when I do ask a question it is answered right away. There's one Pacific woman who works at this Wal-Mart Pharmacy front registers that makes me feel great just the way when you're next in line she makes me feel that I have her 100% attention. It makes me feeling great and I wanted to tell people in Omaha if you shop at Wal-Mart Pharmacy nice people at the Wal-Mart - stop by the pharmacy on 132nd L Street. I her and all the workers at the store keep up the good work. Thanks guys these people. Thanks for my review and reading it. I walk away with a smile when she's there. I feel she doesn't judge me and that's what I like. Thank you.
*: I have been on ** for back pain. I have been to several Wal-Marts trying to get my medication. One pharmacy told me to come back when the doctor office opens so he can speak with the doctor and even then, he said there is no guarantee he will fill it. I am 53 years old and don't want the surgery so I rely on pain pills. I hate the way the pharmacy make you feel about your pain. I just got it fill last month at the same pharmacy. What is the problem? I have chronic back pain and I am so tired of going through the same thing every month.
*: I went to have my meds filled and like always, there's a problem at Wal-Mart pharmacy... any them, especially Lenoir City, Tennessee! I go up to the lady at the drop off counter and ask to get 3 of my medicine filled. (There was also a big ordeal about the meds as well, because obviously they don't know how to do their jobs and most of the time don't know what they're talking about anyway.) After I wait a few min, I go back up and say "Oh, I would like to pay cash for two of those please, don't put them on my insurance." She says "Okay and uh oh I forgot to call you back up and tell you, not don't have 'the enough' ** tablets to fill your prescription, I can order them and have them for you Tuesday." I said "I haven't had them since yesterday," she replies back "I can order them and have them here for you Tuesday." And remember, she said "I don't have enough to fill your prescription."
*: I was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease from a doctor here in Colorado Springs and she has put me on a pill with the name of **... I told the doc to send the prescription to the WalMart Store on South Academy in Colorado Springs, what she did 2 days ago. I called yesterday morning if the prescription is there and ** the Pharmacist confirmed this.
*: Been waiting one hour with only one patron in waiting. Two pharmacists on duty could not care less. Cannot blame cashiers since they cannot take your money until product is ready. Antibiotics and pain medication. Not the first time either. Will strongly consider another pharmacy next year.
*: The appearance of the meds change frequently - size, color, shape, labeling. Frequent changes make it impossible for the consumer to know if they are getting the right medication or not. Also country of origin not put on prescriptions and personnel do not know that info. I was told a med I take was mfd in Maryland, USA when in fact it is made in China. Price also changes. I paid .02 cents for 90 day supply. Cause for happiness or concern???
*: I left my Prescription To fill my medicine and the employee his name Is **. He said he does not hold prescription and he was laughing about me even know he was a pharmacist.
*: On Saturday afternoon around 1:30, I went into Baytown Wal-Mart to pick up a prescription and as I walk to the line to wait for my turn the cashier finishes checking out the customer in front of her and looks up and tells me "going to lunch will be back in 30 minutes" and the gate goes down!! Really?? I let her know I was in line and the gate was still up when I was in line. Rudely she continue to clock out and leaves. Wow!! I'm so upset with this kind of service and will make sure not to use Wal-Mart pharmacy again.
*: This issue went on for years... we fill 3 heart meds monthly. Every single month at least one med was out of stock, the prescription was messed up. We were told it was not their fault, call our doctor, call our insurance, it's a computer glitch, wait 2 days & they'll have it (we live 47 miles away!) make another trip, etc. etc. Every single month something was wrong. We would call ahead, yes it's ready, then no it's not ready. Pharmacy manager ** (29th SW store Cedar Rapids) has been so rude and insolent we asked for the manager several times... he was always out & an assistant made excuses. I would love to talk to the actual store manager. Anyway, our employer (General Mills) hooked up with Express Scripts and we are getting excellent service by mail. SHAME ON WALMART, we do shop there still and refuse to deal with rude **. She should be looking for a job.
*: To my extreme dissatisfaction my Insurance chose Wal-Mart as our prescription provider. I cannot say enough about how unprofessional, unbusinesslike and uncaring Wal-Mart pharmacies are. Yesterday was the last straw! Today I filed a formal complaint with BCBS against WM pharmacies. I suffered a severe fall in 2013 that caused a whiplash and damage to my cervical spine. I have been on and off pain meds ever since. Each time I need to fill a prescription I call WM pharmacy a week in advance. They have failed 85% of the time to even order my medication. Seriously, I fill it every 2 weeks and it is not cheap!
*: Wal-Mart Pharmacy at City Square employee very unprofessional and refuse in any help at all on refill of prescriptions. I have others filled there but since 2 of them are controlled substance that I am for forced to take (since a 60 day stay at Wound Center )with MRSA which I caught with surgery at hospital). Most individuals and all medical staff are aware patients just can't stop taking abruptly or may cause serious if not fatal situation for the patient. I was told “no permanent Pharmaceutical Employee there and we don't have it.” I asked over and over “so it was not ordered?” Employee was rude. Said "We go through this with you every month.” Then she hung up. Also said "You were that I was the one shouting.” I have hearing loss but was not shouting at any time. 
*: We spent 3 months in Boone, Ia. and used the Walmart pharmacy there. I had to use it at least 5 times during that time and each time was a disaster. If they didn't have enough to completely fill my prescription, they would say my insurance didn't allow it. I knew it would so insisted they run it again and then they'd tell me I was able to but they didn't have enough, so come back another day. This happened at least 3 times. I understand sometimes they don't have enough for 3 months but be honest, don't tell me I'm not allowed. If I have to come back, no problem but if I get only 1 month at a time it's more costly. There were other mix-ups and downright rudeness of most of the techs. I would call in for 3-4 refills and receive only 2, after 2 days after requesting them. 
*: This has been ongoing for several months, but it took me until a month ago to find this out. I am a trucker, so I have to for the most part refill my prescriptions at Wal-Mart pharmacies as it's next to impossible to get a tractor-trailer to anywhere else. Lately, however, I have been home on weekends, so I am refilling my prescriptions at my local Wal-Mart in New Bern, NC.
*: Once again today I went to the Walmart pharmacy in Statesboro Georgia to purchase generic 12-hour cold medicine. I had purchased (1) box at the 1st of April. Today is the 25th of April. I went to the counter where they asked for my ID which I gave them. The guy came back and said I had been denied because I was over my limit. I asked them if GA state law was still 3 boxes or 9 grams per month or had it changed? I then asked to speak to the manager of the pharmacy. She came around and asked if the law had been changed. She said no it was 9 grams per month. I told her I had not bought but 1 box this month. She said she was sorry she could not sell me anymore. I told her in my opinion she was breaking the law. She said she was sorry. 
*: I dropped my Rx and I stopped by the pharmacy after 4 days. I have been told "is not ready" then they found the order came. I wait till they finish, but not the full amount, so I have to have another trip to get the rest. Almost 10 days and no one call. It is not the first time. That happened 2 times before and the pharmacist has no experience and she does not care. Location WalMart pharmacy in 75th street, Darien, IL.
*: North Frederick MD Walmart -I had made this pharmacy my primary pharmacy that I used for a long time. I live in md but work in northern VA and Washington DC so I chose a doctor closer to my work than home Walmart pharmacy had been filling my prescriptions. I advised the pharmacist that I would be switching doctors, it was a little closer to home and they provide better care. He said "that was great." When I brought my prescriptions in they did not have the meds, to come back, this was on Friday 3/7/15. They told me to come in Saturday, their order didn't come because of the weather. On Saturday they said it didn't come, to try back Monday. On Monday they told me to come back Tuesday. Tuesday they told me the meds weren't on the delivery, to come back Thursday. Thursday they received their order, filled 1 of my medicines but the other medication, they only had in a different strength.
*: I waited in the Kittanning pharmacy line for pick up longer than I waited in the checkout line with my groceries. ** was the name of the employee. She spent more time talking than getting people through the line. I had one person in front of me, she spent at least 20 mins with the one person. Everyone in that line seemed annoyed. If I noticed I dk how she didn't. I did say something once I got to the front, how it took 20 mins to wait on one person. She literally snapped back at me. "I can only wait on one person at a time" and I said "for 20 mins?" and walked away. She went to say something else but I wasn't arguing with her. I took less than 5 mins. The poor lady in front of me got told to wait 5 more mins and come back both times right before the lady stepped aside. ** said wait and took another 5 mins the 1st and the 2nd. I think she looked or put in the customer’s name under her maiden name. 
*: We have been getting our (considerable amount of) medications filled at Wal-Mart in Sierra Vista since we moved here in 2011. We have experienced shortages in prescription medications and even the wrong dose which nearly put my husband back in the hospital after a heart attack. This month when I was to get my monthly 90 ** pills, the pharmacy again did not have it. 
*: Wal-mart Pharmacy on Ruthrauff and LaCholla in Tucson is ALWAYS ridiculously understaffed! This is not only dangerous, but as a customer I receive extremely poor customer service. I've sat at the drive-thru window for as long as 1/2 hour waiting to even be acknowledged that I was there! I've dropped off prescriptions many times, have gone back to pick them up only to be told they don't carry this medication, or they're out of stock and don't know when they'll get more. No courtesy call to inform me of this to save me an unnecessary trip nor have they ever offered to check with their other stores! When I bring scripts in after a doctor appointment I went to because I was deathly ill, I'm told to come back in 4 hours to pick them up! Really?! It's absurd! What happened to the 20-45 minute wait time?
*: I will NEVER USE WALMART PHARMACY AGAIN!!! The pharmacist at the neighborhood market pharmacy in Longview, TX on Gilmer Rd and Heritage has a SEVERE attitude problem. Have had numerous problems with scripts for my grandson who suffers from ataxia telangiectasia getting mixed up or never filled but getting told they have to call for refills first even though I hadn't even gotten the first one yet! Then yesterday...the straw that broke the camels back. 
*: I went to Walmart on MacArthur Rd in Whitehall, PA to have a few scripts filled. I have recently been approved for medical assistance and was provided an ID# to use until I receive my insurance card and the pharmacy representative, ** told me to call medical assistance customer service number to obtain a bin#, and a group number, and provided me with the number for provider services. I called them and after being on hold for 20 minutes I got a hold of a provider services rep and explained what I needed and she advised me that the pharmacy is responsible for obtaining the information they were asking me for. 
*: My problem with Wal-Mart pharmacy in my area is not the staff, it's the ever-changing $4/$10 generic lists. I don't know how many times I have had to have my doctor change my blood pressure medications all because they are taken off Wal-Mart's generic lists. It has gotten to the point, I'm not even going to use Wal-Mart anymore except for the one medication I take that I can still get for $10 for 3 months' worth. When that one is taken off, they have lost another customer. I was driving 20 miles just so I could get my medications cheaper and get my groceries at the same time, but now, I will just shop locally or go to the local Kroger store if I want more variety as far as groceries or need something I can't get local.
*: My doctor called in my prescription at approximately 4:15pm to the Collinsville, IL Wal-Mart. I arrived at the pharmacy at approximately 5:40pm and was informed it would be another 10-15 minutes. I returned 15 minutes later and was informed it would be another 15-20 minutes as they needed to confirm my address. After confirming my address, I returned 20 minutes later to be told it would be another 10-15 minutes. I informed the worker that this was my third time attempting to pick up the medication to which she responded, "You can wait in the drive through but you will need to move if another customer arrives." She did not attempt to apologize or remedy the situation in any way. 
*: Owensville, Missouri. I called in for refills of the same meds I get every month. This time, though, there was a mix up. They gave me 2 of the same med and zero of one. The dates on the bottles didn't match either which I found odd. I called when I found them and she told me a manager would call. The next day, the manager had someone else call to tell me that was impossible and didn't happen. They were going to call my insurance and call me back. No one called. I stopped by this afternoon to talk to them and was basically called a liar and told there was nothing they could do. My concern is something happened and they are not taking it seriously. So off to CVS next month for me.
*: Walmart - Sterling Ill. Failed to use information available in system or follow up with any questions. Had wait to get prescription then wait again for them to apply insurance then wait again to confirm amounts. Timely courteous professional is part of their job description.
*: I have filled scripts between Walmart and Sam’s club for 20 years. I take a script in to get filled. Same script as I have filled before, and the pharmacist on duty decides that because it came from an urgent care clinic, he was not going to fill it. When I told him that that was "**", he got visibly angry and said that I could not come back to that store. I spend close to 1000 dollars a month on various goods, but I will take it somewhere more appreciative!
*: I picked up a prescription on 3/17/15 which has always been filled without charge to me as I have a card from the company who makes the drug. I was charged for the drug and paid thinking something must have changed. I went home and checked the paperwork sent to me by that company, called the company and found out I was still to be getting it without charge. The company representative looked into it and came back and told me whoever filled it did not put my card through. I returned to Walmart today to pick up another prescription and informed them of the mistake and was told I could only GET A REFUND IF IT WAS REPORTED WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS. I asked where that was written and was told it wasn't really written anywhere but that was just the Walmart policy. I told her I had never read that on anything and had never been told that either. 
*: I have been a Walmart pharmacy customer for a few months. I am having a hard time signing on to the web site to view my rx accounts, order prescriptions, view order history, etc. I went to the pharmacy and was told I would have to call an 800 number because the pharmacy doesn't have a link to the web site. I called the 800 number a couple of times. The first time I was given a phone # for a store in Wisconsin. Another time I was given a referral # to call back in case my pharmacy couldn't help me. It seems that there is an issue with the link between Walmart and the web site. With all the technology we have, you would think this would be easy to fix. BTW I work for a different Walmart store and it's the same story. I would like to have this problem resolved ASAP. Thank you.
*: I have had numerous problems with finding items on the shelf at this store. Some years ago, I complained about this problem and for a while it improved. Now it is back to the same situation of empty slots, which entails another trip to the store, which is a ride away. I thought that with the expansion of the store, things would improve, but alas, that doesn't appear to happen.
*: My insurance agent talked me into dropping AARP Rx prescription insurance and "save money" by going with Humana - Walmart plan. Biggest mistake I have ever made. Walmart does not work with my doctor. Prescription I ask for is not met and they just don't give a darn whether the doctor puts it on script or not. Save money my foot. A person could die before they get what the doctor prescribes.
*: I was told couldn't use the pharmacy drive thru to get syringes for my diabetic dog even though I've never had to go in since that particular store opened. I've been getting those syringes there for over a year and never have any problems before today (3/22/15). But for some reason today, ** the pharmacy manager who has waited on me several times said I couldn't get them and that he had never allowed me too. So basically he called me a liar. Well he's the one that lied.
*: Someone from their corporate headquarters called my mother and me to apologize for the actions of their pharmacist. My mother switched to a different Wal-Mart with very friendly and accommodating employees. She has since passed away from cancer but the pharmacy at the new Wal-Mart were wonderful.
*: I've used the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Center located on Ruthrauff Rd. at La Cholla Blvd. in the City of Tucson Arizona for my food & shopping needs since they opened..... EVERY TIME I drop off a script to be filled at that location, I make sure to request a PICK-UP time for when my Medications will be filled... AND every SINGLE TIME they screw with me. Today was just another like the rest. I signed for my meds, gave them my I.D. & then had to sit there waiting till they decided that they wanted to release my medication.. I dropped off a single script at around 4:00 p.m. today & I just now received it at 7:40 p.m... OVER & OVER again it happens. I have brought this to the attention of the supervisors & they said they would look into it 2 months ago. AND YET today, it's the VERY SAME CONDUCT!!! APPARENTLY, they DON'T NEED ME or my family members as customers. For Fry's, Basha's, Albertson's & Food City is just the road.
*: Completely humiliated after leaving the Walmart pharmacy. Cookeville, TN. South Jefferson location. I asked to purchase a pill bottle with a child proof lid for a prescription that of diet pills with MY name on them that just didn't have a child proof lid on it. It stays in a high cabinet completely away from my children of course, but as a mother of two children I feel I can never be cautious enough. So, the pharmacy tech pretty much looks at me suspiciously like I'm a freaking dope dealer or something... And announces it to the entire pharmacy department that I go to a diet doctor (come on kid, a woman and her weight? Don't be ignorant). Anyways the pharmacist was even worse. Terrible experience, terrible people. Won't go back. Hope they get head lice or crabs! Jerks.
*: My daughter drop off 2 scripts at 2pm 3/13/15. Still not done yet. It's now after 6pm. They also have a problem with saving cards. They bill card and not your insurance first. This is a common problem with the AVON PARK people. They also don't call when your script is done. Hoping Walgreens will be better.
*: One of the clerical not Pharmacists, has an attitude problem. Talks down to me. Doesn't want to listen to what I have to say. Assumes I'm doing something wrong.
*: I had been going to the walmart on in silver spring for 4 yrs. I have a lot of medical problems. I have systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, I have slipped bulging disks from an injury. Well, when they called me up, the main tech named ** started shouting over everyone. He was in the taller part of pharmacy, and other pharmacists were below at registers. Anyway he says, "You know you’re taking too much of these medications, what do you need them for?" I told him it was none of his business, it’s between me and my dr. I am on a lot of meds, several are narcotic. Muscle relaxers, I get leg spasms so bad it looks like something is in my leg jumping around.
*: Over Thanksgiving I went to have pills filled, “No got,” they said. I left it to be refilled and living 12 miles away I showed back up on 8th day and that included the holiday to pick up. Was told they had filled but couldn’t find it. Guess they put it back. But I could wait 30 mins. And get it refilled again. 45 mins later I got to go home. 4 months later. Early morning, same WalMart, same pills but only 1 other customer in that area. Lady says “30 plus mins for refill”. I believe Walmart has this planned out, tell everyone 30 mins and they won’t sit and wait, they will SHOP and spend money.
*: Several times I have gone to pick up a prescription & found the pharmacy closed for lunch. Usually between the hours of 1:00 & 2:00. The worst part of this is that even when I have waited for them to return, they have come back later than 2:00. I think I will transfer my prescriptions to another pharmacy that doesn't close for lunch.
*: I went to pick up my husband's prescription at 4:00 and was told that it wasn't ready yet even though we were told that it would be ready at noon. The lady asked me if I had more shopping to do as it would be 15 minutes. I told her, "No, I don't have any shopping to do. I specifically came in for the prescription," which should have been ready. The pharmacist then piped up and said she would have to call the insurance company because there was an increase in the dosage. She also asked me if I had shopping to do. I tried to be polite and say, "No, I need this prescription and I do not have time to wait." I just stood there until they figured out what they were going to do. 
*: On 3/5/15 I ordered (by phone) 4 scripts. A recording said they would ready after 10:00 am on 3/6/15. Three of four were. Walmart on 100 Stumer Rd said it would be an hour for the med to be filled. Mail had not been unpacked. I told the tech that I could not wait, as I had to return to work. I ask if I could pick it up at the Walmart on LaCrosse St. She said yes. I ask... that is it? Just show up? She said yes. 
*: I am very frustrated with pharmacists Jeff and Lance at the North Belt Walmart in St. Joseph, Missouri. I have had a hard time sleeping since my hysterectomy and have a script for 20 ** for every 30 days from my doctor. These two pharmacists are acting like they wrote the script for me and give me reasons why I can only get 16 of my pills instead of 20. First they told me that insurance will only let me get 16 not 20. Then they calculated and said I could only get 16 per month instead of 20.
*: Old Hammond hwy pharmacy - I had surgery today in Baton Rouge and was in excruciating pain. I dropped my prescription off and asked if they could please fill as quickly as possible due to my pain level, as well as the fact that I live 2 hours from here. I gave tech my drivers license with all info necessary. At approx 3:05 pm, she said it should be ready no later than 4:00 pm.
*: Refused to fill entire script ordered by doctor - Did not get all medication for the month... Meds added to existing RX another ** on the 25th after knee surgery... How can Wal-Mart change the docs order???
*: I have been having problems where I have called walmart ahead of time to see when my prescription will be ready and they give me a time then when I arrive to pick it up at that time it's never ready. On March 2nd my doctor called in a prescription because I had a sinus infection. I in turn called Walmart and they informed me that it should be ready by 3:30. 
*: Went to the drive thru to pick up prescriptions, rang bell, waited some. Finally came to answer, was told they had a line inside and I would have to wait. 12 minutes later rang again, told "have line-- you have to wait," very rude. If the pharmacy drive thru can't handle the inside and outside why bother to have it open?
*: Turned in Rx 6 days ago. No pills in stock. Won't have Pills for 6 days. Went to pick them up 2-26-15 and there was a line with approx. 15-20 people in it. 6 people behind counter and ONLY 1 checker. Waited over 1 1/2 hours in line. Pharmacist very rude. People behind counter not doing anything. Checker very rude. This is not the first time for being rude too or having to wait over an hour due to only 1 checker. I was looking at the NON working people behind counter and pharmacist looked and me and said, rudely, "WHAT?" I told him that I didn't hear anyone call his name. This is ridiculous!!! 
*: I'm so tired of the discrimination there. At the locations I've been at least. I get ** and they've treated me like crap, rolled their eyes and I've even been lied and hung up on. Screw all of them! (Lenoir city, Clinton, and Clinton why, and oak ridge).
*: Dixie Highway Louisville Ky - I've been getting my blood pressure medication filled here for about a year (the same medication). Each time I've paid $6.00 for 90 pills. The past couple months it's been like pulling teeth to get my prescription filled in full. Yesterday I went to pick up my prescription,(which was supposed to be filled last month for 3 months worth, but they only gave me 1 month and told me it would be automatically filled for the following 2 months in 30 days) it wasn't filled, and they advised me the 261 pills remaining in the prescription would be $208. When I asked why such a price difference the pharmacist says "well yeah I see you've paid $6.00 for 90 pills in the past but this is the price for 261 pills." I then asked how much for 90 and he said $78.00. It's ridiculous. So I went down the street to Kroger, had them transfer my prescription and paid $18.00 for 261 pills. I will NEVER use Walmart pharmacy again.
*: Brought prescription in hand, at first they tried to say I didn't have a prescription. Then they said the prescription was for only 90 pills when the prescription was written for 180. Then finally admitted they had entered it wrong from the prescription... It was suppose to be 180. This same thing has happened 3 times before. This is final straw...switched all 6 prescriptions to Publix Pharmacy.
*: Walmart Pharmacy Fordyce, AR. Walmart didn't have enough of the med to fill my prescription so they gave me just 6 tabs (3 days worth.) They expected more that didn't come but 3 days later they had 4 more tabs. I got them but they put down that I got 6 and took away one future refill. Now I'm down to 1 tab. I called but now I'm no longer in their system. The pharmacist was supposed to call me back but never did. Finally I called my Dr. and had her call a new prescription to a different pharmacy. There is NO excuse for this.
*: My son gave all the information he could to get our dog's insulin. The person waiting on him told him we had never NEVER picked up this insulin for our dog. He stated we have for years but it was not a prescription. He called me and I gave him the same information and she actually told him she was going to wait on others because he didn't have a prescription on file for the dog. He told her again it had been a prescription at one time but was not at this time. She went back to the computer and found a record and gave him the insulin. 
*: Went to fill a prescription. They told me they did not have it after waiting 30 minutes. Told me it would be in the next day at Noon. I come back at noon. They do not have no reason why or when they would get it in. They are not nice at all. They are inconsiderate of customers' needs. They have no organization because each one had a different answer. Then they refused to fill a prescription that was needed for my 6 month old child. Needless to say they should Never never be able to have a pharmacy in Wal-Mart store whatsoever due to incompetence and also the rudeness and do not care whether they have customers or not. They have no I me no organization nor communication skills whatsoever. They act like they are not skilled for their job. That is scary to me. I transferred all my scripts to RiteAid and no longer go in there for anything.
*: I call to make an order yesterday February 14, 2015 earlier Rx** and today it's the 15. I went to pick up my order and it was not ready and the person that attended me gave me an attitude because I asked what the problem was, and this happened the same with another medic. This was February 6, 2015 Rx** -- it was not ready neither and I was also attended in a bad humor. I appreciate if they read my complaints. Thank you.
*: Made 3 separate trips trying to get prescription filled. Pharmacy employee on Wed told me to come back early Friday morning and see this pharmacist (she pointed out his picture on the wall) and he would hold my prescription and fill it when it came in. Last trip I waited on pharmacist to come in and he refused to hold script. Woman who told me he would denied she said that even though another customer behind me stated the same thing happened to her!!! Unacceptable!!!!!!!!!!!
*: Monday, February 9th, 2015 I called in for a refill of a medication and the pharmacy informed me there were any refills left. I was totally out and it was after Physician hours, so I asked what I could do. They told me to come in for an emergency fill. I went in and waited 25 minutes to receive a few pills. Before leaving I asked what the next steps would be, to insure I receive the medication, and they told me they were going to notify the physician's office. Thursday, February 12th, I called the pharmacy to ask if the prescription was ready and I was told the physician's office hadn't sent anything over. 
*: Thirty days before my daughter gave birth, we filled a prescription at our local Wal-Mart (Jacksonville , Il.) from her OB/GYN. The prescription was for ** 25mg. but she was given ** .25mg. Her nursing staff at a local nursing home where she is employed and myself questioned it, but agreed he could have been lowering her heart rate in order to help her sleep (which is what the script was for). When we arrived at the hospital, the Doctor wanted to see her medications. At that point he became very upset, stated he never prescribed ** and would never have prescribed. He stated he would call and visit the local store to look into the matter. 
*: On Tuesday February 10, 2015 I went to the pharmacy to pick up a prescription refill I had called in approx. 2 weeks before. I live near Seward, but in a different town. This was the first time I was able to pick up. I arrived at 1: 27 pm. The tradition of this pharmacy is to close at 1:30 for lunch. The woman who was to help me, told me she couldn't find my prescription. Later she said, they put it back on the shelf. And then at 1:29 pm she said and I quote: "This door is supposed to be shut at 1:30" and then shut it while saying "we will look into it in 30 minutes". She shut the door before we had finished talking. I spoke through the door and said, "Don't bother. I probably won't be back." This follows another time a month or so ago when I picked up a different prescription. 
*: I've been shopping and doing business at Walmart for years and have slowly seen the decline of service at this chain store. I just returned home from a visit to the pharmacy at Walmart in Thomasville Georgia and am so disgusted at the way I was treated - I have pulled not only my prescriptions, but my entire families. I was flat out denied service by their pharmacy when I requested a single box of **, despite them knowing who I am, where I live, and having filled my prescriptions for years. This pharmacist was rude, and treated me like a criminal giving me the 5th degree, and playing 20 questions. I have never been treated like this while simply trying to get a simple sinus medicine to treat a sinus headache. I've had problems with this particular pharmacist before over filling medications in the past as well, despite having a doctor’s prescription. 
*: This one is simple. Awful "workers", awful customer service, awful knowledge. Please tell me Walmart will have their "workers" that "work" in the pharmacy go through some kind of training. I do not want to go there to pick up a script, be looked at like a moron, and have this person looking at me with dead eyes not having a clue what they are doing. It is just sad. I do not trust them. I don't not want people like that making sure I stay healthy. Try again Walmart.
*: Today which is February 2, 2015 I called my Walmart pharmacy to let them know that the high blood pressure pills they refilled for me on Monday were the old pills. Well when I talked to the pharmacist to tell him I needed my new prescription of blood pressure pills, that they had refilled the old pills. He went to tell me this was the only high blood pressure pill they had on my records. I told him how when I had been getting my new pills since August 2014. He proceeded to tell me they only had a record of my old high blood pressure pills. I do not understand how they don't have a record of my new prescription for my blood pressure pills when I have purchased these pills for 8 months now. What kind of people do they have running this pharmacy? When they have no record of your medicine you purchase every month.
*: I needed to get a prescription filled today. It's a narcotic pain reliever. Lately Walgreens has been awful about getting these filled. Taking an hour and a half, researching your Rx history, then after waiting telling you they don't feel comfortable doing it and refusing to fill even though you have a Rx from a surgeon. Well today I used Wal-mart Pharmacy in Pascagoula, MS. It took about 45 minutes and was completely hassle free. I even got with the pharmacist and discussed my history (4 back surgeries, the latest 1 moth ago), and the fact that I have been on pain meds for about 4 years. 
*: Have been on 3 meds for 14 years. This person refused to fill one...since WHEN does a pharmacy employee have the authority, or the right, to overrule a Doctors orders??? I will never spend another cent in any Walmart anywhere. This is a medication I am unable to work and earn a living without. And I am going to complain to The State of Florida and the media. I have been screwed for the last time. I intend to make this hurt.
*: Over the years the staff has become ruder. Wait times for refills are ridiculously long and the prices keep changing. Today I purchased an OTC medicine that is kept behind the counter. It was the wrong thing and I was charged before I could tell the cashier. When I explained the situation, I was told I couldn't be refunded. I didn't want a refund, just what I asked for. The pharmacist turned her back on me and walked away.
*: My physician has tried to calling a script for numerous days at different times to no avail. The phone is always busy, even though both he and I have tried on different days and at different times. The people there act like it is a bother to accept and fill the scripts. I have spoken with the head of the Walmart pharmacy and he has acknowledged problems at this location and they are trying to fix. LOOKS LIKE IT ISN'T HAPPENING. I WOULD ADVISE EVERYONE NOT TO USE THIS WALMART IN LANSING IL. IT'S HORRIBLE.
*: Have always used Walmart for my pharmacy needs. Moved to a new town and their Walmart Pharmacy is horrible! It is a good thing I do not need my meds immediately because it's been 4 days, and they still are not in stock, or they have to "call my Dr.".
*: I presented a prescription at the window of WalMart pharmacy in Sonora CA, and was told it would be ready in about an hour. I returned later to pick it up, patiently waiting in line, and then told by the cashier that they are out of this Rx. Why, for god's sake, can't a person be told they are out of a particular drug when presenting their prescription (as it is being posted in the computer) rather than wasting my time and pissing me off! The cashier told me the onus is on the pharmacist to make this happen, really!
*: The Walmart at 60 noble Blvd carlisle pa is constantly out of the $9 blood strips for diabetics. It's very inconvenient for a type 1 diabetic to travel to another town in hopes they are in stock there. There are some people who don't always have the means of getting around to find their every day needed stips and cannot afford to buy a large quantity of boxes to stay supplied. Please help us diabetics to be able to pick up our strips at our closest walmart by making them stay in stock. Thank you.
*: Went to pharmacy center at walmart on stapley & baseline at 8am. The technician told me that it would take an hour to fill the scripts. I went back at 10:40am and nothing had been filled. I asked for my prescriptions and went to Walgreen. They filled my prescriptions in 15 mins... Walmart needs to get it together. I will never go back to Wal-Mart ever again. They lost my business... Sincerely, Your Asthmatic Customer.
*: I have been using the Wal-Mart Pharmacy on Market St. in Gilbert, AZ. Recently they started giving medication in the pop-out packages which is child resistance. I requested, in writing, that they not give me the child resistant packages or containers as I'm over 75 years and have no children in my home. They continued to give me medication in the pop-out packages. I spoke to the pharmacist and was told they do not repackage at this store. Needless to say, I am in the process moving my prescriptions to another pharmacy.
*: I took my medicine to Walmart on Monday, Jan. 12, 2015, told them I'd like to sign up for text messaging for status and such, ok. Come Thursday, I hear nothing and I am out of medicine, I call to see if it is ready to be picked up. I was put on hold numerous times as they couldn't seem to find me in the system, then I was told my prescription is ready for pick up. I go to get it and I am told to go to consult window to talk to the Pharmacist. He tells me he can't fill this medicine because I got it filled twice last Nov., and I am on the national pharmacy list as having physically received it twice in Nov, mind you this is Jan 15, 2015 today! I tell him he is incorrect and I did not, and even if I did, this is a brand new prescription written on Jan 12, 2015. He said he cannot give me my meds and I need to call my doctor. So I called my doctor, she said that is ridiculous! 
*: Dislike the new packaging of ** pills. Very hard to remove pills. If I empty & throw away the box, I no longer have my prescription Rx number. Also, have a lot of check-out lines, but seldom have enough of them open (Menomonie & Eau Claire, WI). Sometimes wait as long as 15 minutes or longer--no acceptable!
*: The pharmacy at 1725 w hunt hwy, queen creek az is a joke!!! There is usually what I call a "cast of thousands" running around there, no one knowing what they are doing, laughing, talking about their personal problems. Dropped off a prescription for bp yesterday at about 3:30 and was told today at 10:30 am that they have no idea when it will be ready as they have 250 prescriptions to fill. Is this my problem? This is a recurring issue. It would appear that I will be taking my multiple prescriptions elsewhere in the future if something isn't remedied very soon. The aggravation is not worth it. This pharmacy doesn't even rate 1 star and am disappointed that there is not a negative rating.
*: I cannot count the times I have went to the counter and been looked at like a drug addict. I go to a real spine dr., have multiple problems in my neck and back, I am 61 yrs old and not an addict. I was told a yr ago I had to bring all my prescription there so they won't look like pill pushers. I did that. Now every time I go it's 'we don't have that', if not why are you a drugstore. I don't get it! And no I really don't...soooo fed up but don't know where to go from here. Even tried other stores - nobody has it. No shortage - we just can't help you, what, do I look like an alien????
*: I have type 1 diabetes. I used Wal-Mart pharmacy for about four years with no problems. However in the past year, I have purchased three worthless bottles of insulin. I ignored the first one. They replaced the second one without a problem. However I bought a third bad bottle on 12/31/14 and began using it a few days ago. I discovered it was not lowering my BG. I took it back and they said there was nothing wrong with the way they handle the insulin and it must be the manufacturer. They offered to sell me another bottle at full price or try to get my insurance company to approve a new one. I explained I didn't want another bad bottle and I would be going elsewhere, which I did. I had to pay full price because my insurance company would not authorize a new bottle unless I went back to Wal-Mart, but since I'm not ready to die, I just paid the money. 
*: I only go to Walmart to fill my dogs diabetes syringes and to buy the ** insulin which is cheapest here. My dog was diagnosed with diabetes in May after suffering shock and when taking her to the vet her blood glucose was 600! Anyway ever since I've been going to Walmart once a month to get the insulin and needles. I put in the script for the needles the first time and got the Insulin just fine. Every other month I have to drive all the way there after they told me my refill was ready. When arriving and waiting seemingly forever, the needles are never in stock and even the insulin has been out!
*: Had a bladder infection. Went there to get prescription filled. Called an hour and half later - still wasn’t ready... Went to Walgreens. They had it filled in 5 min.
*: I have been dealing with Wal-Mart Pharmacy since they open their first store in St. Petersburg! To date I have never had not one iota of trouble with them at all. Started with them at the Tyrone store, then the Southside store, Central store & now at the Pasadena store!
*: I have never seen a more confused, poorly trained, ill mannered staff behind the desk of a pharmacy in my entire life. It was the only reason I would step into a store like this.....and it is definitely not reason enough. Wal-mart, it gives me no small pleasure to part with you. I was hesitant to try this pharmacy in the first place and when I first walked into the store, I couldn't help but laugh as it was immediately evident that the rumors and folklore about Walmart are actually quite true. What I was not prepared for, is that the rumors extend to include the staff. Even the pharmacist in charge could no more explain the stores' mistake beyond blurting out over and over again "well that's what it says in the computer." When he said it a third time, I began to understand what I was dealing with. What is truly upsetting is that the people who can least afford it are clearly getting less than ideal help regarding their health and the medications which they need. I can go elsewhere and have options, but not everyone does and for those people, I truly feel terrible.
*: In the past two months the wal mart pharmacy has lost my prescription. The people at the Wal-Mart on Jones and Craig look like they're ex-felons, and act like it. How can you prove they lost your prescription (YOU CAN'T). Now again I'm out of my medication, the time and money at the doctor's office and wal mart pharmacy does not care. NEVER GO TO WAL-MART ON CRAIG AND JONES IN LAS VEGAS.
*: Today I go in to the Porterville California Walmart to pick up a prescription they told me 4 days ago would be ready the next day. I go in, they tell me they're two days behind in filling prescriptions. It's been four days, they still have not filled in then I asked my husband coming home from the hospital tomorrow and just found out he's a diabetic. Will he be able to get his ** and ** tomorrow? No, they said it's going to take at least two days or more "because we are two days behind." I threw such a fit about my other prescriptions not being done in 4 days which were on auto refill and lo and behold they filled it within 30 minutes. What's wrong with this picture?
*: I turned in two prescriptions at the Boiling Springs, SC Walmart pharmacy. When they were ready, I paid for them and left the store. I got to my car and opened the bag (stapled shut) to find two prescriptions missing. One was a narcotic painkiller. Upon questioning the pharmacist about it, he said he would review the security video. He did so and informed me that the video clearly shows me leaving with the prescription bag. Well yes, I did leave with the prescription "bag". What the video doesn't show is the contents (or missing contents) of the bag. So now, due to people who abuse these drugs, I have to go a month without my pain medications because nobody is allowed to replace the prescription stolen by a Walmart pharmacy tech.
*: A few months ago I was started on pain management medication **. This process has been a nightmare because Walmart is out of stock in one or the other medication practicality each time I go. This month I've been waiting 2 weeks for my **. They tell me everyone is having the same issue so I checked with a Rite Aid and they told me that simply was not true. I have has two major muscle spasms without my muscle relaxers. Two months ago they gave me a partial refill of my ** because they didn't have enough in stock. When I went to get the other half they tell me that because of the new law they are not allowed to fill my prescription without a paper script. When I asked them why I wasn't informed about this when they gave me a partial, all I got was a “Sorry Ma’am.” After the second issue of out of stock meds I ask them if this is going to be a regular issue and they assure me that they were just adjusting to the new laws. Well that was just another dishonest answer.
*: We had used WalMart Pharmacy for many years. Now all of a sudden when we got a new card (same insurance) WalMart refuses to accept the insurance because there was a union insignia on the card. It is the same insurance. Wal Mart is the only company that is greedy and stupid.
*: I live in San Antonio, TX and fill my prescriptions on the neighborhood Walmart on Marbach and Ellison. I have severe migraines due to my hypertension and my doctor prescribes me **. Well the pharmacist who is obviously a national from Africa with a really bad accent told me that my prescription was bad for me, refused to refill the prescription, and instead of giving me my month supply took it upon herself to give me a five day supply for the entire month. It put my health at risk raising my blood pressure to 196/107, my doctor had to call her to request the rest on my prescription. I believe she is an addict, charged it to my insurance, underestimated me, and tried to stiff me and keep my prescription for herself. When you see her, her eyes are yellowish red, she's shaky, and has slurred speech with an accent. I'm reporting her and the pharmacy to the Texas State Pharmacy Board. Do not go there!
*: Every month I get my prescriptions refilled. Most of the time the wait to get our prescriptions filled is so long that even after shopping for an hour it is not filled. Other times I will go pick up my prescriptions only to be told that one is not ready, it needs prior authorization or that it is out of stock. What ever happened to a text or a phone call? Now, I call my prescription refills in and have to wait 24 hours for them to be refilled. This is totally insane. I also have to call the pharmacy to find out if my prescriptions are ready or not even though they have the new text feature that I signed up for. Now the one prescription is ready but the other one is out of stock and I have until Tuesday to get it filled. I was not offered another alternative to pick it up at another local store. I am totally done with Wal-mart pharmacy. Their business over the last 5 years has gone down hill, they are very slow and hardly ever have anything ready. Thus as a consequence I have had to make 2 trips back and forth from home to Wal-mart. I stuck it out until December, now I will take my business else where. Lastly, it seems like one type of clientele has better success with them than other types.
*: It never fails that on Friday afternoons or after 4 p.m. any day of the week when you go to Wal Mart's pharmacy, there is only one cashier and between 8 and 14 customers in line waiting. According to the pharmacy employees, most go home at 4 p.m. and leave a skeleton crew to handle the rest. Yes, the prices are beyond fantastic but the service is horrible. Why is it possible for Wal Mart to hire cashiers to run the checkout registers but they cannot keep clerks in the pharmacy? This is in dire need of correction. I am a very patient person but even this one tests my patience.
*: I realize that there are a lot of sick people right now, but in my opinion they need to have 2 or 3 lines where you can pick up your medicine. I have been in there several times only to wait in line for 45 minutes to an hour and then I get up there and they don't have it! It has been called in but it seems like they don't fill it until you walk up to get it! What the heck!! If they were acting like they were really trying to get people in and out that would be different! My son went to pick up my medicine tonight and he just text me and said that he stood in line his whole lunch hour and it was not ready and he waited 50 minutes tonight! Not going back! I will get everything in my little hometown where I should be anyway!! I feel bad for my son trying to help me and this is what he had to go through! It is ridiculous and I know something can be done about it!
*: My husband has the same prescription every month. And every month we have trouble getting it filled at Walmart Pharmacy. Initially I could leave his prescription, and they would call when it was filled. Now we were told last month we would have to just keep coming in and checking to see if they had the medication available. This is crazy... Why????
*: I spoke with 2 different Pharmacy employees today regarding my husband's prescription and mine. They both were rude speaking with them over the phone. 1st employee name was Joyce. 2nd employee's name was Don the Pharmacist. I may have to change to a different pharmacy. I don't tolerate rudeness when I shop at that Walmart and pharmacy frequently. 
*: After being told it would be at least 30 minutes to get script filled... it was not ready and was told it would be listed critical "because it takes time" even though they had time to stand and talk empty trash stop and consult.... The cashier went and put script in bag and brought forward, that's it (same person that said it was not ready)... told her I needed to pay part I'm cash and part with card... She didn't want to do it and told someone else I was "stuck in her cash register", this lady came and I told her 2 times that I needed to pay for them separate.... She completely ignored me and rang them up together then when I said that I could not do that she said "I cannot ring them up separate because they are on the same ticket"... Blatant lie because I have paid separate several times.... Will not be coming back here ever.... low prices or not!
*: Went to pick up a prescription and had to wait 10 minutes for one of the pharmacist to tell me about my prescription. The clerk told them they had a customer but apparently What they were do in the computer was more important. Next time if I have to wait I will just put it in the bag and leave or tell them it's a refill.
*: I am the patient of a very prominent doctor in Cheyenne, WY. I presently take five medications on a regular basis and one as needed, which is **. Earlier this Thanksgiving week, my back went out on me. I called Walmart for a refill, and because I was out of refills, knew they had to contact the doctor. After several days, I called the doctor's office as I hadn't heard from Walmart. It is now Saturday evening, and I just received a late afternoon call from my doctor saying they faxed the prescription over on Wednesday. I called Walmart, and they said they hadn't heard from the doctor.
*: The Walmart pharmacy in Tell City, IN. is one of the slowest places I have ever seen. You can be first in line and still hear 'come back in 25 to 30 minutes.' And sometimes after waiting that long you go back and they say "we don't have it." Couldn't they look it up before you walk off. Usually one person checking out, long lines of customers cussing and complaining because they are waiting for younger people standing around laughing with their thumbs up their buts to fill their prescriptions.
*: When I attempted to fill a prescription, the rude woman behind the counter actually tossed it back at me and said "We don't have it." No word on why they don't have it or when they would have it. When I asked, she stomped off to ask the pharmacist, who also said, "We don't have it. We're out until next week." Since when does it take a week to order medications? I am supposed to just stop taking them because they are "out"?
*: Tried calling the Wal-Mart pharmacy in Fayetteville, Tn. off and on for over 2 hours to make sure they received a prescription from the doctor that was being sent or called in to Wal-Mart at 9:30 am. Went to Wal-Mart to pick up prescription, at 4:30 p.m. lo and behold they said never received the prescription. It dawned on me after I called Wal-Mart Corporate to complain that it made sense to me that they did not have the prescription, because they are not answering the telephone. Tried to get Wal-Mart to give me the address or phone number for the company over the pharmacy, but was told that they would file my complaint with the pharmacy.
*: I received three prescriptions from my doctor. I took one to Publix which is right behind my house because it was an antibiotic and was free there and took the other two to Walmart which is about 5 miles away because supposedly they are cheaper. They told me to come back in two and a half hours to pick it up. When I came back three hours later, it still was not ready and they were very rude. Waited another 45 minutes and they charged me 55 dollars for the one prescription. After I left, I went to pick up my free antibiotic from Publix and had the pharmacist look up the medication I just purchased from Walmart - it was only 29.95 there. Ugggg I am so frustrated that not only was it a horrible customer service experience, I also paid 25 dollars more for my prescription. They try to say they are a friendly inexpensive store for the community. Definitely not!!!!!
*: I called the Walmart pharmacy at 1501 E 29th in Muncie In. and was hung up on 2 times, the third try I was put on hold. Twenty seven (27) minutes later as I walked up to the pharmacy counter the pharmacist is finally responding to my call. When I told him I was standing at the counter and had been on hold for 27 min he said, "Yea we're busy, what can I do for you?" I let him know I wanted to know if my prescriptions had been called in and he said yes give him 25 minutes. I let him know I also had one more I needed refilled besides the two that were called in and let him know which one. Thirty minutes later as I make it back up to the counter the cashier informs me she has 2 prescriptions for me, the one I asked to be filled but only one of the scripts that had been called in. It would be another 20 minute wait for it to be filled. I had been put on hold on the phone for 27 minutes then made to wait 45 minutes when it should only have been the first 25 minutes I had been told. And my phone call had been made so I wouldn't have to wait. I had been up since 5am and on my feet for 10 hours and very upset with these people who never even once apologized for my wait time.
*: My brother was T-boned on his motorcycle in 2004 and had his leg crushed so badly the Doctors recommended amputation but were willing to try and save it if that's what he wanted to do. My brother kept his leg but openly admits that had he known when he got hit what he knows now, he would have let the doctors take it. He has had multiple surgeries and is in constant pain. He has been taking ** at the same strength for many years and unlike the druggies with make pretend back injuries, my brothers need for his pain medication is very obvious and well documented. He walks with a cane and on bad days must use his wheelchair.
*: Dropped off med at 12.30 AM. Was told they would be ready in 45 minutes. So I drive home and wait until 4:30 to pick them up. I wait in line for 30 minutes. When I get up there, the guys said, "it will be 45 minutes before your order is ready." I told him it was 45 minutes 4 and 1/2 hours ago. I still stood there and waited for 30 minutes for my meds. It is getting worse every time you go in there. I am finding a new place to fill my meds and all the people I talk to in line today said the same thing. This happen way too often.
*: Childish Retaliation from Wal-Mart Pharmacy in Peru, IL - I have been with our local Wal-Mart Pharmacy for over 14 years. I was always treated very well from these people. Just 3 weeks ago, I had an issue with a very ignorant disrespectful woman going through the drive thru. After waiting for almost 20 mins, I pulled off and went inside. I stood in line patiently and waited my turn. I went up, asked for my prescription and then chewed that lady out for her attitude. She continued to try to speak over me and I had to raise my voice. When the Pharmacist told her to apologize, this Woman REFUSED and continued to call me an ** under her breath. I demanded to speak with the store manager. The manager tells me that they have no power of the pharmacy!! HUH??? So they can do whatever they want?? 
*: This is probably the 3rd time writing about the Walmart pharmacy in Statesboro Georgia. I have not purchased any ** at all this month. It is November 10, 2014. After driving 25 miles to Walmart, I went to pharmacy to get **. When I got up there, the person said the transaction said "denied". I asked why because I usually get from 1 to 3 boxes per month, according to how my sinuses are acting up. I am 62 years old and am so tired of driving this far to have Walmart stiff arm me. What the hell is wrong with Walmart. Can they change the laws as they want? They should follow the same laws as I do and the state laws. Please help.
*: I'm so very angry with Amory Walmart pharmacist of how I was treated so very rudely! I was trying to Refill my pain med and I got online to scan med. It said that my order had been received and that I could pick it up that day at 3:00pm. Well I called them to see if it was ready. They said “no, the 24th.” So here I am confused so I said ok so I scan it again. It says again that it will be ready to pick up that day so I call back. Well the lady was very rude to me and says “Well it just takes an order. You have talk to a real person to get the real date.” Well if so they are lying. I mean why have that online and say pickup today makes no sense and after that the lady says “Look, I just told you a min ago when you called that you can't have it till 24th.” And I told her I was new at scanning it but my husband usually do it for me but she talk so ugly to me like I was a drug head and I ain't no such thing.
*: One day they gave me different price. Then few days later they gave me higher price for the same prescription. I called my ins co and they told me it is up to them - ins company does not control price. When I asked Walmart pharmacy they told me to call ins company.
*: I called to ask some question about my med. coz my pharmacy was closed. Just rude. My mom trades with them but I'm gonna see if she will change coz it is a hassle every time I pick up her meds. plus they stand around and talk too much. They don't take care of the customer. Very rude...
*: The pharmacy at the Rocky Mount WalMart is poorly run and managed. We've used them on and off for 18 years. We use them only for their competitive pricing, but they lack any sense of urgency for their customers and are often rude. They need customer service training. They give the impression because they are licensed pharmacists, they are above smiling, kindness and old-fashioned good customer care. They are not welcoming - their attitudes are "well, what do you want". They are very slow and unresponsive. If we try to discuss medication interactions and have questions, they are dismissed with a "look, this is the answer, now get lost" attitude. We understand that many of the clientele here in Rocky Mount, NC are either uneducated or undereducated, but that is no excuse for treating people rudely, slow to respond and care less! Please pass this on to WalMart officials.
*: I absolutely dread having to submit/pick up any prescriptions or refills, or for matter, deal in any way with the Walmart Neighborhood grocery pharmacy at 109 Gallatin Road N in Madison, TN. I have had to wait at the window for as long as ten minutes at a time before any of the two or three customer service associates, not to mention the pharmacist, decides to acknowledge that I am at a window, only to have them return to what they were doing before I arrived, then maybe they will decide to help me. I have complained to three pharmacists about this problem, but they do not care. The associates all seem terribly depressed, do not display any positive customer service skills whatsoever, and continue to mess up prescriptions to the point that I have had to ask my physician to do paper refills instead of digital so I can make a copy and take them in to hand to an associate personally. So that I don't have to spend hours on the phone between doctor's office and pharmacy getting everything straightened out. 
*: I have all of my prescriptions filled at Walmart Pharmacy. They call and email me when they are running low or ready to pick up. Prices there are the best around and service is great.
*: Family member had hospital stay; when returning home, stop to fill scripts. Those folks at my Walmart Pharmacy took care of me. Made sure I knew about scripts for my family member. They are Great!
*: My local Wal-Mart Pharmacist are difficult to get a hold of. They do not call back, so it's really hard to get a hold of the prescription. Dealing with this made me consider RX by mail.
*: The pharmacists thoroughly explain all medications and how to use. If I have additional questions they answer them and will research to be entirely sure. I've had immunizations, too.
*: The price is right. They are helpful in giving advice. They provide vaccinations and make it easy to get them. Usually, wait times are relatively short.
*: I love using my Walmart Pharmacy. They make it easy to call in to do a prescription refill and usually have the prescriptions I need in stock. Thank you Walmart Pharmacy.
*: My prescriptions are always ready when promised. It only takes a day or two to get any thing that is not in stock. All personnel are professional and friendly. Several even address me by name.
*: I meant to give them a five-star rating previously. Great Pharmacy. Like how the pharmacist comes and talks to you when you have a new medication. That way you can talk to him/her about your allergies.
*: I have always been satisfied with the service at Wal-mart pharmacy. Friendly staff, comfortable wait times and always quality meds.
*: The check out experience is normally good at the Walmart Pharmacy. Sometimes there is a line and they never open a second register.
*: Always friendly, in person or on the phone. Good to check medicines and costs- or see if doctor will renew subscription if no refills.
*: Wal-Mart's prices are cheaper. They have good technicians and the pharmacist goes over your medications with you before you check out.
*: When I ran out of my BP meds, Walmart Pharmacy in Bellmead, Texas they gave me enough to last until they could fill my prescription. Great pharmacy!
*: Nice, attentive, respectful, However I have to continually check meds to make sure getting correct generic, their system doesn't allow for notes, reminders.
*: Good prices but too much turnover of staff, many times they didn't have what I needed, and too long to get it. Wait time too long.
*: Walmart is everywhere. They are quite well staffed. If I am in Ohio, they can fill the Rx. My home store is in Casa Grande. Fast, knowledgeable people. Got my Rx in El Centro, even!
*: Pharmacist is very personable and I’ve grown to trust his knowledge and expertise when changing prescriptions or when I have questions about any medications I’m taking.
*: No one can match Walmart's pharmacy prices. Plus with the walmart app you can renew your prescriptions, prepay for them and bypass the line to pick them up.
*: I'm alerted when my prescriptions are ready by text to my phone which makes it very convenient. When I arrive, the customer service is top drawer. The pharmacists and their assistants are courteous.
*: I’ve been using Walmart pharmacy for several years now and I have never had a problem with them. I also get my annual flu vaccine. I am on Medicare now and pay very little for my meds.
*: Our experience with the pharmacy usually include waiting for a prescription. Even if this is simply a pickup there is usually a wait involved. There have been times of pricing inaccuracies.
*: Walmart's customer service is impeccable, their pharmacists take time out to speak with you about any concerns, and their costs are lowest under any insurance.
*: Very good pharmacy. The only issue was having to wait for almost a week for them to actually get the medication that was prescribed. The pharmacist was very thorough with reviewing the medication.
*: The pharmacists are knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful. I asked them numerous questions and they do their best to answer as thoroughly as possible, with options of other products.
*: I love Wal-Mart pharmacy because of the price of prescriptions plus they readily take Good RX without any problems. Almost always my meds are available.
*: Walmart in my neighborhood is very slow to get pen needles. But I found that if I go to the neighborhood Walmart in Sugarland they would accommodate me. I don't understand that.
*: They've always worked with me getting my meds done, customer service is the best. They order ahead so I don't have to wait. Great delivery service.
*: I love the early hours for seniors because of covid-19. And they have been much more responsive in the new procedures they've implemented to address that. Their text messaging follow-up has been great.
*: Great service, reminders of when prescriptions are due, they will FedeX your prescriptions if desired at no charge, drive through service, they will call your doctor if a prescription has expired.
*: I pick up my husband’s prescriptions at the Walmart pharmacy every month. When I called in for refills or inquire about Physician’s sending the prescription over, the pharmacists are polite. Kind.
*: The Pharmacy manager of Eldersburg Maryland refused to fill my spouse's prescription because it looked "tampered" with. It wasn't but this was the second time this particular manager did that to him with the same controlled substance medication ** prescribed for his ADHD. On another occasion the pharmacist grilled me about why I needed my vitamin D prescription. He said he didn't understand vitamin D helped with pain. He is the pharmacy manager as of 11-5-2014. I caution anyone to use that pharmacy.
*: I'm tired of calling in prescriptions and if out of refills they say to give them one business day to get a hold of doctor. Then you give them 2 days or sometimes 3 and they still don't have it. If they don't want to do this then they should not say they will. Gas is not cheap to keep running back to get them. And I'm real sure if they would look at computer it's all ready has new refill because my others do and they always call all of my prescriptions in at same time. It's getting very old. I'm not the only one I've heard complain about this store!! Walmart needs to look into this pharmacy. WILMINGTON OHIO 45177. Thanks.
*: My Dr called in a prescription at 5pm, came to pick it up and they said they had just received 5 mins before they closed so they wouldn't be able to process it. Which is a lie because I know the Dr put it in 2.5 hours before they closed! They were eye drops for my 2 year old and they wouldn't do it even though they were helping other people, then try and tell me they are closed!
*: I recently filled a prescription for my pain medication (60 pills) four days ago. I had received a larger size bottle which looked a little on the empty side, but I just wrote it off to it being a bigger bottle. However, last night I counted my pills and realized that I had only 35 pills left. I know that there is no possible way that I have taken over 20 pills in that time frame. I know exactly how many I have taken. Which is 8 pills, since I only take 1 pill twice a day. Big difference. I called the pharmacy to see what could be done to correct this, but the pharmacy tech just kept saying all their counts were right and nothing could be done. I'm never taking my prescription to this or any other Wal-Mart pharmacy again.
*: I called the pharmacy and ask them to refill my ** and the pharmacist got really hateful to me and made me feel like a piece of dirt. I was told that if the refill was in the system before the 6th of October that you could refill them but before I could finish he started being really rude telling me he did not care what I was told and just being hateful as hell.
*: Your ignorant pharmacist does NOT know how to be sure to take care of pain management patients! Much of the time PAIN MANAGEMENT DR'S prescribe meds to work together to help MANAGE pain & unless you suffer from something that causes you pain (or in my case several diagnosed issues causing chronic SEVERE pain) & don't know what needs to be done when an insurance company says that a different med is a duplicate even though it's a totally different med and works differently with the central nervous system and in conjunction with that "duplicate" to at best improve the quality of someone's life they have NO business working in ANY pharmacy! Pharmacists are not Drs. and should know how to override the transaction! This is not the fault of the insurance company, they are merely an obstacle! She should be absolutely ashamed of herself and so should Wal-mart if they failed to teach this to the staff. In any case, they did NOTHING to try to resolve the issue - NOTHING! Not to mention they screwed up 3 other Rx's times in a matter of 4 days. I WILL NEVER USE THIS PHARMACY AGAIN.
*: My doctor from Kansas called in a script for pain around 11 am to pharmacy in Oxnard, CA. The pharmacist on duty was Jane. I went an hour later and they turned me away saying that it was never called in. I left and within a few minutes this pharmacy called my Dr office wanting to know what my birth date was. My wife then called pharmacy back and Jane complained about being the only person working and again said she did not have it. Then got nasty with my wife and when terminating the call failed to hang up the phone. Continued being verbally nasty about my wife to co-workers in the background. 
*: US 19 Hudson Florida - Bought script here from NY. Waited 3 days to have a blood pressure med filled. Told the rest weren't ready, it would be hours. Then had a med signed by np they wouldn't accept but never told me. After 4 trips I gave up. Have never seen anything like it in my life. Makes me want to walk away from Walmart in general!!!
*: I called Walmart Pharmacy in Tilton on 10-07-2014 to call in my insulin needle prescription renewal. I got a call today saying it was in. I sent my wife to pick it up. BIG MISTAKE! She assumed that the pharmacy had my insulin needles prescription in the bag which was stapled and she paid with her debit card. When she got home I open the bag and instead of my usual 200 needles, ** brand, there were 100 BD brand, 100 short. 
*: For the last few months I've been thinking I'd lost my mind. I have to take ** for rigors that are a lingering side effect from being on ** before so I'm prescribed 90 a month. Lately I've been running out early & thinking someone had been stealing them or that I'd been losing some. This is a very strong medicine that has to be kept up with very carefully. I've been taking this for over 10 yrs. To be short I will say I finally started counting them when I picked them up from WM pharmacy and they've been putting only 60 rather than 90 in the bottle. Now I called and the lady at the counter pretends she miscounted them but I don't believe that. Furthermore she's not the pharmacist so why would she be allowed to handle such a strong drug? 
*: My wife went to the local Wal-Mart Pharmacy and needed some **. She was not sure of what type our last package was (type of application and either 12 or 24 hr) so she called me. I told what the last box was. The pharmacy tech would not allow her to purchase it for me. Dooh, I know that since I grew up in Oklahoma. She informed that she was buying it for herself and was still refused the purchase and then the tech even told her he could call the police since she asked someone else what type we take. I fully understand that it is against the law for a person to purchase/aid a person who is on the registry, which I am not, but the tech could have explained it better. No wonder people hate Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is wondering why a small town now has 2 Walgreens and a new CVS. Sam Walton would be stunned how his company has turned out.
*: On May 3, 2014, I took my prescription to Walmart @ 800 HWY 64 East in Wynne Ark. I later realized that I was given 2 different medicine in the same bottle. One was a 10MG of ** which was the correct one according to the pharmacist that was on duties on 9-1-14 and the other prescription was a 800 MG of ** that I was not given to me by the doctor. One night I poured a pill in my hand and 2 different one came out and I got scared, I didn't know what I was taking or what I was supposed to be taking. I took this medicine to the Walmart Pharmacy in Memphis who informed me to take it back to Wynne where I got it from. I know that 2 different medicine should not be given in the same bottle. I hope this does not happen often; this is a serious matter, this is my health.
*: I went to Walmart to pick up my prescription. They charged me $115.00 for what was supposed to be 10 pills but they only gave me 3. So when I asked about the other pills, they said they were out of stock, so when they had them ready they call me. So I went back to Walmart, once they called me. Said they weren't going to charge the 7 pills but when I got there they wanted to charge me $115.00. I asked to speak to the manager and he didn't consider my opinion or try to help. He just brushed me off and the pharmacist didn't even try to help me. When I had went to pick up the 3 pills, he didn't even bother telling me how many times a day I had to drink the pill. He ignored me. He's a racist and so is the manager.
*: I don't know if this is legal or not what Walmart did? If someone knows please let me know. It happened this month; September 2014. I have been on 2 types of anxiety meds for over 4 yrs. One for anxiety and one for sleep. There has been no problems til this month. One was prescribed by my psych. Dr and other by my arthritic Dr. I had the Same 2 Drs the whole time. This month when it came time to reorder my psych med. (I do it online through Walmart), the refills I had weren't there anymore. The sleep med was but I was out of refills.
*: Several times this year alone, I call in for refills that are out of refills..... So they say they sent a fax, but my doctor never sees them; let me correct that, they get 1 of the 3. So they refuse to refill them... that's ok... I am not asking them to fill expired prescriptions. However, as care providers, part of the medical system, you think they would either retry to contact the doctor after a few days, or call me, or something to let me know I won't be getting life care medications (Diabetes); instead, they wait for you to show up, and if pressured will "resend" the fax's that will never appear at the doctor. They care so much you might go 7 to 10 days without medication.
*: I went to Statesboro, Ga. pharmacy to purchase a package of generic ** 12 hour on the 12th of September 2014. I had not purchased anything for the month of September. After waiting for a while I finally got to the person behind the cash register. I told them what I wanted, they got the package and took my license. They then said it would be the 13th before I could get any. I take 2 a day as suggested on the back which means in 10 days I am out. The law for Georgia reads (3.6 grams per day or 9 grams per month, 3 boxes). How the hell can I purchase 3 boxes when I cannot purchase 1 box in 13 days? Statesboro pharmacy changes the state rules and should be fined for causing this kind of dumbness.
*: The Novi, MI Walmart pharmacy has only been open for a couple years. I started going there when it first opened until I started to have issues with one of the women pharmacists. Every time I had to go into to the pharmacy she gave me a hard time. I stopped going but unfortunately I had gotten a new insurance that would only allow me to get my prescriptions at Walmart. So I have no other choice. Not one time did I go in there and could get my prescription and then walk out. This pharmacy is the most unreliable, inconsiderate, and has the worst people working at it. If I could give them a -100, I would. They seriously disgust me.
*: Caution!!! Walmart (Radcliff, KY) no longer accepts ** coupons as of 9/8/14. According to mgr **. There is no sign or warning in the pharmacy. ** has generous $6 coupons in ads. Don't be sucked in. W-mart DID accept them but according to ** customer service they do not have to anymore. I know Walmart is having money problems during this recession, but an ad or tv spot warning about new policies should be given. ** will reimburse for coupons, but that is apparently not enough for Walmart.
*: I believe I was treated rudely and unprofessional by the pharmacist. He told me he was uncomfortable giving me a prescription that my dr. prescribed for me and told me he didn't like my attitude towards the ladies working in the pharmacy. I have never been rude to anyone there. I may have sworn once or twice but always apologized to them for my language. I feel the pharmacist had no reason to refuse the prescription my dr. ordered and was talked down to like I was a junky, therefore I changed pharmacies to Hannaford. At least they treat me like a person. Thank you.
*: I have been prescribe ** for a little over 2 years now, there are many people that probably misuse this medication.... I myself have legitimate reason to be on it for pain. I've had two back surgeries and I'm in constant pain.... Every time I go to call my prescription in, the pharmacist answers the phone as nice as he can be, as soon as I give him my name and date of birth he treats me as if I'm addict! Even gone as far to tell me that they do not have my prescription in and it will be 3 days before I get any. But usually within the hour I get a text on my phone telling me that my prescription is ready for pickup! Was also told that I had to pick up all 84 of them at one time which would cost me a total of 400$ instead of allowing me to pick up a week at a time! 
*: Wal-Mart alerts notifies us of our Rx being ready to be picked up. Arrive at Wal-Mart in Carrizo Springs, TX to find that Rx are not ready, and when inquiring about approx. time they will be ready, pharmacy clerk ** is so rude and will not give accurate information, leaving customers with unanswered questions. As a Senior Citizen having to travel to our nearest Wa-Mart pharmacy sometimes creates an inconveniences. I am very dissatisfied with the quality of service at this Wal-Mart/pharmacy.
*: I have had two bad experiences within the past three weeks. In the first situation I was told that a medication was not in stock. The staff could not tell when they would have inventory. Hard to accept for a business with the buying power of Walmart. Today they refused to refill another prescription, despite knowing I am leaving the country and do not have enough to complete the trip.
*: My doctor faxed a prescription to Wal-Mart Pharmacy August 21, 2014. The pharmacy called me and told me my prescription was ready for pickup. I have medicare and the prescription was for glucose strips for measuring blood sugar for my diabetes. I went to Wal-Mart to pickup and was told the doctor didn't put a diagnoses code and I would need to pay $150.00. I didn't have $150.00, so I told them just forget the prescription and left. At this point everything was fine. However, today, August 28, I got a phone call from the pharmacy saying my prescription was ready for pick and had a 0 balance. I thought that was odd, but that they must have called the doctor's office, so just to be sure, I called the pharmacy just to verify that I had a prescription for glucose strips with no payment required. I was told by the pharmacy person, "yes that was correct," so once again I drove to Wal-Mart and again I was told that would be $150.00. So I drove 20 miles and wasted an hour of my time for nothing. The staff in that pharmacy is totally incompetent, and absolutely lacking in customer service.
*: I went to get my prescription filled. I have a ruptured ear drum and am having pain. So the Dr prescribed me some antibiotics and 10 **. Ok, so I went and paid for the high ** prescription. Got to car and something said count your pills. I had five instead of ten. I went back into store and told the pharmacist that I only had five instead of ten. Everybody behind the counter was looking crazy like I took the medicine. I do not take those on the regular. So one of the dudes behind the counter said that I had to wait until Friday until they went back on the tape. Meanwhile, the girl with braid was behind the counter looking stupid. So the pharmacist went and counted pills from the bottle and said that ten were gone and that I had to wait until they were able to view the tape. But I paid for ten and only have five. If you ever decide to go to Walmart Pharmacy in Baker La, I suggest you count any pills that does not have a seal on them. Employees do steal.
*: While most of you come here to report your incident... I think it would be in your best interest to file a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau. They will investigate and make a determination plus ask you what you would like to see happen along with contacting the right person or individual in charge of the pharmacy you go to as well as seek to remedy such incidents in the future so they don't occur again... and to as well as reprimand the party or parties involved. They do contact them. The site holds the complaint for over a year where all over the world people can read and see just how this company treats its customers...
*: I have been there three times to get prescriptions faxed in by dr. First time told me 15 minutes. They filled the script 45 minutes later told me they only had half. Second time I went script was $4.00 faxed in by dr four hours earlier. I get there, was not filled because they were not sure if my dad wanted to pay $4.00 for the medicine. Seriously?!! Had a script called in yesterday. I called, I said "I know the prescription is expensive please fill it I will be in at 7:30 to pick it up". I drive there the half hour it took me and I am told "Oh we're sorry we are out of stock." So one would think that they could at least have the decency to call me and let me know. Will never use this pharmacy again!
*: I have no complaint about my Walmart Pharmacy. They have always got my pills in stock. And it don't take long to get them. They are quick and care about the people that come in there. I always see a smiling face - In Franklin, KY.
*: How about the 90% of pharmacists just do their damn jobs like they are supposed to and stop acting like they have an "MD" or a "DO" at the end of their names?!! Some ask questions about why we are taking certain meds and it's none of their business. You are damn doctors!!! You should of went to med school if you wanted to be a Dr!! Either fill the damn script or don't!! At least have the balls to say why you won't fill it if you choose not to! Some of you I would like to jump behind the counter and knock out! You all tend to judge people based on their meds! God forbid you walk in there with a script of ** for legit reasons.... they look at you like a doper!! I'm so sick of that crap!! 
*: I was at Walmart pharmacy this a.m. for 30 minutes waiting for my son prescription for pink eye. As anyone knows, this is a very contagious disease. Although the good-looking blond that was just in front of me got her meds in 15 minutes, I was told that we had another at least 15 minutes to wait for my son's bottle of eye drops. The pharmacist then helped another cute blond by leaving the pharmacy area to discuss the possible treatments for HER son's eye infection, which looked serious. With two pharmacist and other helpers, they take 45 minutes for a bottle of eye drops? Really? Don't use Walmart Pharmacy. Rude and LONG WAIT!
*: I have been dropping wife's prescription off at Wal-mart for yrs. I was told by the pharmacist that I need an ID to drop off a prescription. WTF. I need an ID now to drop off a prescription? Why? Can someone tell me? I totally understand picking one up but not to drop them off... I beg my wife to stay clear of Wal-mart. If it's not one thing, it's another. This place is getting {or} already too big for their own good...
*: I went to Wal-Mart to have my prescriptions filled. I didn't realize until I got home it was quite a bit missing. I am in my 50's, it was for pain my doctor was really upset. I called she was rude and said they do not make no mistakes. I asked her to check, she said there is no need. She called other stores and even told them not to have fill my new scripts. I was so embarrassed, I called the manager. They said they looked and there was no mistakes made. I just went to the store and home so where could they go? If I only would have checked but I will never return to Wal-Mart.
*: Called in refill on Friday, was told it would be ready after 12 noon on Saturday. Went to Ephrata Pa Walmart, waited in line and then was told med wasn't in stock. I work for a home care agency and need to pick up meds for clients on a regular basis and this Walmart in the past 2 to 3 months has run out of insulin and test strips. I am beginning to think this Walmart needs someone to take inventory on a regular basis.They dont seem to know enough to reorder their stock.
*: Our Part D WellCare has reduced our choices to Walmart, Kmart and a mail order place. Since the first of the year, we have had 4 medications that we have indicated by their phone system that needed refills with the expectation they would call it in as promised. It hasn't happened. I thought the one for thyroid was something the doctor didn't want me to take, so that it had been cancelled. Nurse very upset that I did not continue taking it!! Husband's heart medicine has not been the full count. Two short every time. Also, I had bronchitis and was prescribed a cough medicine. I picked up one of the other prescription, but never got the cough medicine. I was so sick that I couldn't remember what was missing when I got there. We are 77 and 75 and this is no small thing.
*: Recently, I was stunned by the smug incompetence of a store manager, after pharmacy employees lost my prescription and cancelled it without my permission (without even having filled the prescription). The store manager was so set in his assumption that looking at the camera footage would be "due diligence," that he refused to have an employee look for the lost prescription the old-fashioned way. "It's not where it's supposed to be" was all he could muster, and no employees in the store's pharmacy took the initiative to conduct a search. Concerning the manager's self-described "excellent due diligence," he told me that the camera angle did not permit him to say definitively what had happened... And yet he referred to his camera system as "excellent." Making matters worse, rather than admitting even to the possibility that an employee lost or even misplaced my prescription, an employee inputted in "the system" that I had cancelled the order and the paper prescription was then returned to me.
*: I called in a refill for my pain med. Have been on them for years, my Dr said he had called it in so no big thing. After about an hour I call the store and was told it was done. I go in and the cashier who is very sweet says that she can't see it on her computer but will go look. About 5 minutes pass and out of the blue, the pharmacist comes out and says that there is a problem, that SHE thinks the Dr didn't call it in, that she thinks that I did. I have a great relationship with my Dr and so I call him at home. He tells me that he had called it and didn't understand what the issue was. He then stated that he would like to talk to the pharmacist but she refused. I finally after an hour of this got my meds. But I am now changing to a different place that I know the people and they don't treat you like dirt.
*: I have lived in Conway s.c. my whole life (47) yrs. I have shopped with Walmart most of those years. But just recently I stepped away from my pharmacy that happens to be private owned. Because I don't have insurance I found Walmart to be a lot cheaper. This was approximately 3 years ago. I take a controlled med for pain, a med for anxiety, and a low dose med for sleep. I have 3 bulging disc, sciatica, carpal tunnel (both hands), tarsal tunnel left foot, tennis elbow and my latest diagnoses and most pain thing I've ever endured is a torn rotator cuff in my right shoulder. It was found in 2007. I was told to go thru p/t 3 week for 3 months. I did and was surprised at the results. All was well until 6 months ago when it came back with vengeance!! My Dr had to put me on a much stronger pain meds. And says I'll have to have surgery, which I can't because of no insurance. Needless to say, my husband and I are trying to get as we speak. 
*: I have been shorted 3 different occasions and didn't notice two of those times till the end of the month. Those times I just chalked it up to maybe me taking a couple extra here and there when having a higher than normal pain day. Well since the 2nd time when felt shorted, I purchased a weekly dispenser and a combination lock box. This time got home I noticed that in my container was much less than usual. I am not a drug seeker. I understand that this may be common with narcotic prescriptions. I WAS 53 PILLS SHORT. OVER 1 WEEKS WORTH. 
*: I will start off by saying never again will I go to a Walmart for prescriptions. I may take it further and not go to Walmart period. I spend over $1000.00 a month at Walmart. I dropped off my prescription at 7pm and the assistant asked if I want to wait for it to be filled. I stated, no I would pick it up in the morning. He stated ok, it will be ready for you. You will get a text. The next morning, I still had not received a text and I had to go pick up the prescription and start taking it prior to surgery.
*: Waynesboro Va. 22939 Wal-Mart Pharmacy - Had 3 strokes. On 04/11/14 Dr. give me prescription for ** for real bad headaches. Dr. told me to take 1 to 2 every 4 hours. My headaches keep getting worst so I had a Dr. Appointment with my Dr. and told him I was having trouble with my head and I was out of my pills. So he wrote me a new prescription even though my other one shouldn't have been done with. He knew I was using more than what he wrote out for me the first time. But also said my headaches were worst than better. I couldn't help it. I had a Ischemic stroke (brain stem infarction). So we left there to go to Walmart to have refill on a Friday. 
*: Background: I work in the healthcare industry and somewhat understand Rx formulary. This means some insurance plans cover some drugs and not others. They often pay in tiers. When a generic is available they may not pay for Brand name drug, or they may require a higher copay. I was filling a prescription for my husband which I filled at Walmart four weeks earlier for myself. Same doctor, same script. The last time I got this filled, it was either an hour or two wait, or the RX would be filled from central location in a day or two. The Script ok'ed generic substitutions. 
*: I have been going to Walmart Pharmacy & CVS for over 7 years. I give them the same address each time. Some blonde female rolls her eyes at me and tells me they won't fill it, they don't have to fill it. I have been battling for over six months regarding my schedule 2 prescriptions. I went there April 2nd and Pharmacist Hoang screamed, “Oh my God, that is a lot of drugs.” I said, “I get this every month for the past 14 years. Nothing has changed. Check your records.” He refused to fill it and CVS had refused to fill it. They told me they were robbed and refused. Hoang said he isn't going to fill this. 
*: Went to Niles MI Rx to get my scripts...wanted to pay at registers up front..was told I couldn't...cashier says that's what's in computer.. As I tried to look at my receipts she sarcastically said "that won't tell you anything".. I asked again why I had to pay there, she went to RPh Jackie and Jackie told her to tell me I would have to talk to RPh manager who wasn't working.. Also on my script bottle the name area on all my scripts says Joan **... I know darned good and well Jackie knew what was going on.. She has been there a long time... Sorry this is not in the correct format.. But I have had a stroke and it is very hard to type.. I would like someone, other than the Rx manager to contact.. I have had many issues with this Rx.
*: I received my regular prescription for Hypothyroid condition, and it smelled weird like chemicals gone bad. Anyway I thought must be my imagination so I took it and that was on February 18th, 2014. Ever since then I have had symptoms of a under active thyroid which is why I was taking the medicine in the first place and the smell began to get stronger more pronounced. I called my doctor and he advised me to take the medicine back to the pharmacy. 
*: I switched my pharmacy from the Walmart Pharmacy on 15th Avenue and Bethany Home Road to the Walmart pharmacy on 19th Avenue and Bell Road. Since the change on the numerous occasions that I have gone to this pharmacy, not one of my prescriptions have been have been filled seamlessly. There is always a problem. Coming down today, either don't have the medication that I need, they claim to have never received the request from the doctor's office or never to ever received what they need to fill the prescription as far as the insurance. I have been told to come back on numerous occasions.
*: I recently moved from NC to VA. I transferred my prescriptions from the old Walmart to the Walmart in Stuart, VA. I always get my prescriptions filled on the three months for $10 plan, and was especially glad to use the plan when I moved as Stuart is 30 miles from my home. I have used the plan several times and planned to use it again when I called in my Rx for **. I was quite surprised when the pharmacy tech told me they can't fill it for 3 months "It wasn't written for 90 days." I explained to her multiple times that I have a 60-day script with 3 refills, which to a person with a brain equals 3 months of meds. I finally gave up and asked to talk to someone else.
*: I had to pick up a medication for my mother in law. It was not a pain medication - it was for a sleeping aid and she was instructed to take at half dosage. The poor woman hasn't slept since she lost her husband of 52 years two weeks ago. She is in excellent health, just hasn't slept and it is taking its toll. Her family physician prescribed 5 pills. The pharmacists made her feel like "an opium addict" (her words) and refused to fill the script until they conferred, not with her doctor, but with each other!?! Clay Walmart has lost the entire family's business. And I have told everyone I work with, socialize with, etc. When it hits their revenue, maybe the pharmacists will get a crash course in customer service!
*: My father has received his medication there for at least 1 year. My mom gets her meds there and we have went to getting ours there. I went to Walmart Pharmacy to talk to them about my father's medication about when I can pick them up because one of them is controlled. That was on March 3, 2014. I told her do not fill them, I will call back when closer to the day she told me I could get them. On March 10th, I received a call that they filled both of his meds and if I didn't pick them up, they will put them back on the shelf. I asked if they could hold them until Friday Night, March 14th, I would be up to get them this week and she stated yes they would and she would put a note for them to hold until Friday Night. 
*: Tropicana Boulder Highway Wal Mart, Las Vegas, NV - Dropped my prescriptions for insulin pens and Walmart prescription intake lady said they would call when ready within 24 hours. Two days later no call from the Walmart pharmacy, and when I called the pharmacy a man who could not speak English well enough to understand kept telling me that the insurance did not cover the insulin so it would cost me $1,000.00.
*: I want to give some POSITIVE feedback and overall satisfaction about my trip yesterday to the Murphy, NC Pharmacy dept. The people there really offered tremendous help and assistance to reach out and meet my customer needs. They "DO CARE" about the customer!!! I had a new Rx filled at a local pharmacy in town but the generic drug price was higher than I thought it would be. My Rx plan from Humana gives best prices thru Walmart pharmacies. So I contacted Walmart and told them my circumstances... They quickly registered me into their system, expeditiously contacted to transfer the script and even told me it should be ready for pick-up later that day!!!
*: I am unfortunately on Workmans comp. I understand how a prior authorization is required and can be aggravating at times for all. However I have notified my pharmacy ahead of time every time so it can be processed so a prior authorization can be requested. I am told each time after the PA is approved that my medication will be ready on a certain day for pick-up. Somehow the refill order never gets done and I drive to WalMart Pharmacy to find out that the rx has not been completed and I will have to wait, this is after calling and even visiting the Pharmacy days before. It has happened every time!! Today (03/13/2014) is another day that this has occurred. I called my rx in on Monday and was told it would be ready today so instead of driving there to be told it is not been filled yet I called prior to leaving. And again I was told it wasn't filled and would not be ready for a couple hours. 
*: My doctor ordered a new prescription for me at the Gail Gardner Walmart in Prescott. He wanted me to have 1.5 pills, and this caused confusion. Then they told me that the way it was, they'd have to charge for 2 prescriptions. I had my doctor send a new prescription to another pharmacy, and they got it right. My dad was charged more than he expected, and they claimed that the insurance raised not rate (not $65) in 1 month, and we discovered that the pharmacy sets the price, not the insurance company. They lied to us and blamed the other organization. Walmart is dishonest, and I won't go back to their pharmacy. Costco's prices were actually lower than Walmart by 80%.
*: I am a very understanding person but the local Walmart Pharmacy has crossed me too many times and the public needs to be forewarned, (3) times given wrong medicine, once given another individuals whole bagged prescription with their name and address, should have said something but didn't. Today (Female Asian Indian Pharmacist) refused to fill my valid script after keeping me waiting 1.5 hrs., said she had to call him first. This was a printed "Official" script, signed, same as before but I was refused.
*: During the past 12 yrs I have continually had problems with both my own Rx and my last dog, as well as my current one. I no longer fill my own Rx at ANY Walmart Pharmacy as they were never ready, hadn't come in the shipment or "claimed" they didn't carry a particular item. Just too many hassles. My last dog was on meds for collapsing trachea, thyroid, and different antibiotics as he got older. My Vet would call all Rx in herself and always did so the same day, but about every other time when I went to pick them up, they would say they had not received a call from her... She finally started faxing them in, yet seldom were they ready and I'd have to wait or come back.
*: I went to Walmart pharmacy today to drop off two rx, one for my 5 year old and one for my 2 year old. These were identical meds with the exception of the dosage being different. When I went to pick them up I was given my daughter's with no problem and was told that my son's insurance was not valid. Now mind you I just took both of them to a walk in doctor today for illness and they had no issues with his insurance. So after I paid $35 for a rx that should not have cost me a thing I come home to give my sick children their med. I give my son's his with no issues and then go to give my daughter's to her and it is in a powder form. It was never mixed to begin with! 
*: I work at Walmart Pharmacy. Most of you have legitimate complaints. I won't even fill my own prescription's there because it's such a hassle. The higher ups make their own laws and ridiculous rules that we are forced to abide by or be fired. We are understaffed and unappreciated by corporate.
*: Had to transfer from Walgreens to Walmart in the beginning of the year due to insurance. When I went to fill my ** they filled it with Dr. Reddy's manufacturer's brand. I have been on Teva's meds with no problems for years. I went home and tried it for 2 days. It felt like I didn't even take the med. I had a horrible headache and couldn't function. This happens when I forget to take the meds on time, but this was happening while I was taking Walmart's meds. I went in and asked the pharmacist if they had any of the Teva meds or if they could order them for me and they said they couldn't order them because of a manufacturing problem.
*: A year ago last January 2013 I started getting 3 prescriptions for my dog. They kept changing the price all the time (up) and I found these RX cards/coupons to use. It took me almost all year to get Walmart to accept them for anywhere close to the numbers on Goodrx.com. The misfilled one bottle with what they tell me is ** and a stay awake drug from Walgreens. They said they used their surveillance tape to say they filled it with orange pills but didn't show me the tape. There is no Walgreens in Piqua. I don't go there and we use try to sleep meds not stay awake meds. In addition the pills should have been used at the same rate as the others. Where are the pills he's supposed to have? Walmart says there are trust issues and to go elsewhere.
*: (Tulalip Walmart, WA) I know that pharmacies require 2-3 days for a script refill, but when I called for a refill they said I had none left and that they would need to contact our doctor's office for refills. I called the next day and they said they were still waiting for the doctor's office to call them back. Had I known that we were all out of refills, I would have called 3 days in advance but this was for an inhaler needed badly.
*: We've been using Wal-Mart Pharmacy for over a year now. My husband has about 8 prescriptions per month. They have messed up his prescriptions so bad that I have to visit them 3 times per month. They have been so late on getting his medications, that it's terrible, they have overcharged me too.. Please do not use them... Go to CVS or Walgreens.. I'm transferring all of his medications today to CVS.
*: In October 2013, I had my prescription filled at Altus, OK Walmart Pharmacy. I had a 6-month prescription. I went to get my refill in November and was told they no longer give out more than 1 month's supply of this medicine because of a new law in Oklahoma. They did NOT tell me this when I went to get my prescription originally filled in October; if they would have told me that then, I would have sent off for my prescription using my mail order pharmacy service to get my entire prescription filled. But instead, I used a local business thinking it would give them money. BIG mistake on my part. From now on I will ONLY use my mail order pharmacy, instead of giving Walmart pharmacies my business.
*: Three days ago, I called Wal-Mart in Asheboro to refill a script; one that I had gotten there twice before. I was told they would have to fax the Dr. for approval (which I didn't understand because the bottle clearly stated there were refills remaining), but I said okay. I called the next day, was told they had not heard from Dr. I called the next day at 10 AM. This time, I was told it would be ready for pick-up in 30 minutes. I live approx. 30 miles from the store so I waited until 2 PM to go to Wal-Mart, only to be told that they had not yet heard from the Dr.! I'm like, "I was told 4 hours ago I could pick it up in half an hour, so please recheck your info." She goes to a lady I assume was a pharmacist. 
*: We go to our pharmacy to get my husband's **. Every time we do, the lady at the pharmacy tells us they are out! So I call corporate and am told they are not out! So I go the next day and the man there says I don't know why she says that we have some! That woman LIES every time we go and she is working!! How many times must I call and complain about the same thing??? I have removed all my scripts from your store, stopped shopping your store and just walked out of there for the last time! She is a wicked person to keep a med from someone who needs it!
*: If you have a prescription for any schedule narcotics with **, please ask the pharmacist to do a count. I have had prescriptions for 60 ** 7.5 and was given 54. Again I had a prescription for 20 ** and was given 19. Every time the pharmacist makes a check, they say all is accounted for, translating into no accountability. If this is happening to me, it must be happening to others. Please help stop the abuse and report it. The funny part is they are real quick to offer money back on the missing pills. Too bad it won't help with the pain in my broken arm.
*: Got my prescription refilled at our local Walmart. Just plain old blood pressure meds. There was a change this time. Instead of a bottle of pills, it came in a sheet of individually sealed pills. How the heck am I supposed to get them out? The arthritis in my hands makes this impossible. Store says, "That's how we get 'em. Don't you have any friends to help?" Unfortunately, I don't have any friends to help. What incredible jerks. I will not buy ANYTHING from Walmart again.
*: I ask my Dr. for a ** medication for next month and they told her a remark on my last refill emergency treatment for September. It's end October and always have this medication refill every 2 months in my past with another Dr. I told this to Dr. ** and she did not believe me, and ask one of your employment information on my medical script. I feel this is going over my privacy, when I submitted a registry record to Dr. ** for my treatment. Because of this, she refused to give me my meds yesterday. She made me go back today for my 20 pills refill of ** for November month. 
*: They now wanted 26.00 for the same prescription. When I asked, they got mad, said they got the wrong bottle. They changed it in the computer and then gave me the same bottle back. Then the ** insulin I been paying 11.80 now went to 24.88. They said it was a price increase but the manufacturer said there was not an increase. Tried to get Wal-Mart customer service but good luck on that.
*: My doctor phoned my prescription in to Walmart Pharmacy after my local pharmacist did not have the product available. Several hours later, I drove 18 miles to pick it up, but it wasn't ready. The technician claimed they needed more information from the doctor. I called, they called, and the doctor's office assured us that the information had been sent. There was a digital receipt to confirm this. Next, Walmart claimed that Medicare would not pay because of some technicality (I forget now what they called it). Back to the doctor's office. The problem, I was assured, lay with Walmart, not with the doctor or her office and requested another follow-up call/fax. 
*: I loved working for Walmart Pharmacy when Sam Walton was alive. Things changed. Everyone running the company got a little too greedy and their associates don't mean as much as the consumers who get lowest prices and best services. The company used to stand by their employees but the customer is always right seems to fit even if in the wrong now. I would like to know the longest time a pharmacist has worked for Walmart Pharmacy since Sam Walton passed on. They would rather hire new pharmacists than pay for life insurance, stocks, 401k and any retirement benefits to save money. I saw myself and right after me another pharmacist who worked over 20 years with the company get fired. Florida is a "Right To Work" state where big companies like Walmart have so much control. Lawyers are afraid to take on Walmart because they will lose. 
*: I am a post-op patient and I need a certain prescription filled so I called Wal-Mart in Inverness, FL to ask if they had the drug in stock and I was told they couldn't tell me over the phone. Know that is ridiculous. It is not the only pharmacy in my area that has told me that but this is not the only time I have had problems with them. They have been rude to me, very slow about their work and not very knowledgeable. So overall the highest score I can give is the lowest score available to me. It seems to me an even decently educated staff is beyond Wal-Mart.
*: I had dropped off a prescription before the day it needed to be filled to ensure they would have it ready when it needed to be picked up. I got a call telling me my prescription was ready, and so when I went to pick it up the next day, I was told that they had pulled my prescription to fill another order. I was not called or contacted when they did that. And so the pharmacist who was there on duty when I went to pick it up said they shouldn't have done that and he could call other pharmacies to get it filled.
*: I went to Walmart to pick up a box of **. I waited in line for 30 minutes. When I finally got to the front of the line, the lady said they were out. That is way messed up. Could they put up a sign saying they were out of **. In Statesboro Georgia, besides their attitude of treating you like you are a criminal when purchasing sinus medicine, they ask you questions that I feel is harassment. I hate the pharmacy and the snooty people working there..
*: This comment is about the Pharmacy at the location in Carlsbad, NM. I am extremely disappointed in the ability of the associates. They were unable to transfer my prescription, despite me giving them the bottle with the store's number on it, within 48 hours. The associate told me it was an incorrect number, but I called it and got through. The pharmacy that I was transferring from was located in a different time zone, but having the contact information for more than one day should have made the transfer possible. Furthermore, there was one cashier and one pharmacist for a community of over 26,138. It is impossible for two people to keep up with the needs of the community. I now have been 3 days without my prescription. It is for a type of medicine that has negative effects if it is NOT in your system. This is unacceptable. I will never bring a prescription to Walmart again!
*: I had a root canal today. The Endodontist who performed the root canal gave me a prescription for 12 **. Your pharmacy would not honor that prescription because it wasn't printed on security paper. I asked if it would make a difference if they communicated directly with him & they said it would not, that unless I have a prescription written out on security paper, they could not fill it for me because it is a narcotic. As much as I understand this policy as it was explained to me not once but several times by not one person but two, it is my opinion that your employees took extreme measures to prevent me from receiving medication that would alleviate my pain from the root canal. The Endodontics office I received the root canal in was an hour away, and was already closed for the evening, so driving back there for a rewritten prescription on different paper was not an option.
*: My 10-year-old dog has UTI. I went to a vet in another town while I was on vacation and had to see a vet there. She received treatment and a week's worth of antibiotics. She seemed better for the first week, but then started showing signs of the UTI again. The vet was called, and they decided she needed to be put on antibiotics for a longer period of time. She was in pain and the UTI was causing blood in her urine. They called the prescription into Walmart Pharmacy at the neighborhood store in Bedford, TX. My grown daughter followed up for me, and they told her they had to order it and it would be ready the next day. This concerned me, but I understood.
*: I was at the Walmart on Annapolis Rd, Landover MD. On July 3rd, I was picking up my medicine and the pharmacist was not only rude to me, but also to the cashier. Also, she gave me the medicine of someone else, Ms. ** (and my name is Wanda **), whom I had the pleasure of calling to let her know that I picked up and paid for her medicine. I then called Walmart and spoke to the pharmacist and she was not concerned at all, nor did tell me to bring back the medicine; and lucky for me, I always read my bottle before taking it.
*: Since when has it been mandatory that you need a prescription for an over the counter medication? I am trying to purchase 1 box of ** 12 and they won't sell it to me without a prescription. I think this is ** and when it is not the law, why do we have to do it? It's over the counter medication!!!!
*: I had my RX filled at Walmart in Nacogdoches, TX as usual. I was at work so my wife picked it up for me and brought me a pill. A little back ground: these pills come from the manufacturer in a sealed pre-counted bottle of 30. She noticed the seal was unusually easy to remove. A few days later, I noticed a pill was broken in half, in fact, several pills were broken. I was puzzled; how could this have happened? I didn't do this. My wife told me the seal was there but it was just laying there, not glued. 
*: I bought a year's supply of ** Mist inhalers before they went off the shelves. After I ran out, I started using my nebulizer with **. I went to Wal-Mart Pharmacy today in Irving, TX. I waited in line to ask if I would need a prescription for **. After 10 minutes of waiting, the pharmacist told me I was standing in the wrong place to ask a question and to move over 10 feet to another line, after 2 customers that were not in front of me were helped first. 
*: It is May 4, 2013 and allergy season has been bad in Western Pennsylvania with pollen counts 10 to 12 this week. ** 180 mg OTC does not work for her so the doctor called in a prescription of ** 12 hours. ** is the only one that is non-drowsy for both of us. My daughter and I both get weekly allergy injections but she is suffering more severely than I am.
*: I went to Wal-Mart in Garner, NC to get a prescription of ** that my doctor told me I had to take every day, indefinitely. The doctor said if I missed one dose, I could have a heart attack. I got to the pharmacy two hours before they closed. I asked for my prescription and they said 25 minutes to pick them up. I shopped around for a while and went back to get my prescriptions. They had three of them filled, but not the ** that I had to have. They said it had already been filled. They looked again and said they would fill it. I waited another 30 minutes and they still didn't have it filled. I was late picking my son up, so I had to leave to go pick him up. After dropping him off, I headed back for Wal-Mart. 
*: I refilled a prescription for **, 90 tablets. The bottle is prepackaged and sealed by the manufacturer with 90 pills. When I got it home, the seal was broken and off the bottle and a red line was placed through the "quantity 90" on the prescription label. I decided to count the pills and came up with only 67; it was short 23 pills. I immediately called the pharmacist and was told that the red line indicates that the filling pharmacist has to count and double count the quantity as it is a controlled substance. Why would they need to open a sealed bottle to count when they are prepacked for the quantity being filled? The second pharmacist I spoke with claims they have the prescription being filled on video showing a sealed bottle going into the bag. But then, they couldn't count the pills! A complaint has been filed with the PA Board of Pharmacies for sanctions. At this point, I don't even want the 23 pills. I just want my prescriptions out of there!
*: I picked up my prescription and when I returned home, the bottle did not look like it normally looks. When I counted, there were 30 missing. I called the store and they informed me that their count was accurate. They told me I should call back and talk to the manager. Well, I talked to the manager and she too informed me that they were right and I was wrong. I was the only one to handle this medicine from the time I left the store. I have called my family doctor and told that office. I will be going to Wal-Mart today where I will meet with a county officer to fill out a report. I have also called and left a message with drug control but I am still waiting for them to return my call. I will go on every site I can find to make other people aware. 
*: I ordered a prescription refill that was due to expire in a few days. I forgot to pick it up and when I was able to get back to the store, the computer had pulled it and they wouldn't give it to me because now it was past the expiration date. I explained that it was ordered before the day, but they did not care about my needs. I will now have to make a doctor appointment and pay for that to get more refills! I will be taking my business elsewhere. They can't build the new CVS pharmacy fast enough to suit me. I hate Walmart in general for numerous reasons.
*: I picked up 2 prescriptions for my 12-year-old daughter. I got home and realized they gave me someone else's medication. Thank God I looked at it before I gave it to her. This worries me that something like this could happen. I understand human error, but maybe they need to double check what is in the bag before customers leave. I would have hated to see what would have happened had my daughter taken this other person's meds. The cashier was very nice and helped me. Also prior to this, the other ladies couldn't find my insurance info. I was a bit disappointed that I got no apology. It was just like, "Oops. Okay, here you go."
*: I dropped a prescription for my 92-year-old father on Monday, March 18. I was told it will be ready by Tuesday, 19. I went to pick up on Thursday, 21, and it was not ready! I asked then why they promised it the next day. The girls answered, "We have to tell the customers the next day." It sure won't be that way! Okay, Monday, 25, same girl said, "Oh, they sent us only the 5mg because they don't have the 10mg! Do you want it?" I said no and I won't be coming back until you call me that it's ready, and you do whatever you want. 
*: They gave me a medicine that I have told them three times previously that I could not take. Then, they would not give me a refund with return of medicine.
*: Every time I go to fill a prescription at the Port Orange location, it is never ready, whether it is for me or my husband. They never have it ready, and I again have to wait in line sometimes 3 times. This is unacceptable.
*: I have been utilizing my local Wal-Mart (Shelton, CT) pharmacy for the past few months, to obtain my monthly prescription. Every time I went in, I would be forced to wait an excess of time, as they did not complete my script. I spoke with the pharmacist who explained their text message alerts that would alert me when the script is ready for pick up, which I found useful. Other minor issues with the staff being snotty, careless, and even a female pharmacist with eye-rolls to make any pre-teen look angelic. However, today I had the absolute worst experience I have ever had at a pharmacy, let alone a public store.
*: Pharmacy Protocol & Miscounts by pharmacist on C-2 prescriptions: On Feb. 8, 2013, I entered Walmart at 9:15 a.m. and, as with previous times, I have my C-2 meds. filled at your Mexico ME store Zip code 04257. I have always left my hard copies of my C-2 pain meds several days before they are due to ensure that the pharmacist has ample time to order or ensure that on my pick up date, they have enough of each med I need because of policies that most pharmacies carry, and especially myself for I am contracted with my doctor to use this pharmacy. 
*: I was prescribed a generic medication - 3 pills a day for a total of 90 pills, a one-month’s supply by my calculation. Walmart advertises generic meds $4 for a one-month supply. When I went to pay, I was told it would be $10 for a 3-month supply. I had the pharmacist read the original prescription and he concurred it was a one-month supply and charged me $4. I asked if I would have to go through this next month and he assured me he changed it in the computer. This month, it happened again and when I complained, they told me this was what I paid last month. I told them I paid $4 and I was called a liar and to show them the receipt. This was at store number 1736 in Dover, DE. If they advertise it, then that's what they should be required to do, not treat a customer like a piece of crap. I am a retired, educated, 69-year-old man and never have been treated like that in a retail store!
*: I know this is trivial but every time I have a prescription filled at the Walmart in Huntington Beach, they try to charge me as if I have no medical insurance. I have provided them with our insurance information on at least 5 separate occasions. Several times, I paid as if we had no insurance; otherwise, I would have had no BP medication to take! How hard does it have to be? If they cannot verify and store information about medical insurance, I should trust them to dispense drugs! Anyone know a good pharmacy in Orange County?
*: I have recently posted about a Walmart pharmacy and it reminded me of a time I used the pharmacy at a different store with consequences that made me very sick. I had major surgery wherein I had a bone missing from my femur. Long story short, I had cartilage grown in a lab and bone grafted from my shin to fix my femur. I was in horrible pain and had an absolutely horrible time in the hospital - so much so I had to file a complaint because the nurses were terrible one night and I cried all through the night; I was in so much pain (the nurse didn't show me how to properly work the Morphine machine). The pain was so bad my blood pressure skyrocketed and I had to stay longer in the hospital. When I was discharged, I was given prescriptions for pain medication, **.
*: I switched to Wal-Mart because their prices on medication are pretty unbeatable at any other pharmacy. I liked being able to fill medication and shop at the same time. However, three times they have filled my prescription wrong. I was taking a fast acting medication and my doctor switched it to a higher dosage extended release pill. I went online to fill my medication and saw there were no refills left, so I put in the request for Wal-Mart to fax my doctor the refill request. Two days later, I went in to pick up my medications and I am told Wal-Mart faxed my doctor but never heard back. So I called my doctor and they said they never received anything from Wal-Mart. My doctor sends refills to the pharmacy.
*: "I look like a man from Georgia ..." or if MLK went into Walmart. That's what **, Pharmacy Manager at Walmart store #1927 in Macedonia, Ohio, told me when I tried to fill my prescription. I'm from Virginia; I'm not from Ohio. I work and live here and travel home alternating weekends, which means to sync getting my prescriptions (they can't be faxed in), it has to happen while I am in VA so I have them in advance at refill time. When I arrived, I asked if they had my meds in stock. After 5 CVS and even more phone searches, I was surprised that they indeed had it. Strangely, the pharmacy's clerk gave me the full price for the prescription as if to say they are expensive. I said, "I have insurance. Normally, folks ask that question first. I also have a prescription and you didn't ask that either."
*: I just moved to the area and am very disappointed in the Kennewick, Washington Walmart pharmacy. Firstly, all of the techs were chatting to each other and ignored me for quite a while when I brought my prescription to them. They said it would be 30 minutes. I shopped around and came back about 40 minutes later. They said it would be a few more minutes. 20 minutes later, I put myself back in line since they were more concerned helping other people. I asked where my prescription was and I had waited for over an hour! He said it would be a few minutes and I said I had already been told that 20 minutes ago. He then proceeded to go back with the pharmacists and chat again. He finally came back with my prescription. Need I remind you that the prescription just needed a label stuck to the package? No pills needed to be counted or anything. Totally lame. I will be transferring my prescriptions elsewhere.
*: I have chronic worsening pain from psoriatic arthritis and bouts of pancreatitis. I'm on a monthly pain prescription and laws are strict with those. You get 30 days of med and can only get more every 30 days. So when I go to the pharmacy, I am out of medicine. It is a pain medicine I can't skip or stop taking suddenly without severe consequences, so I take my prescription to the Walmart pharmacy. I have no insurance so I go to Walmart. They do have the best price, but not exaggerating. 3 out of 5 times they do not have it. I have to go without that night and go through withdrawal several times. It was so bad I almost had to go to the emergency room (it was too late to go elsewhere and I can't afford). The staff at the Walmart pharmacy could care less. No help, no sympathy, nothing. The response is always "Sorry, it won't be in until..." 
*: I do not like these patches that my Wal-Mart Pharmacy in Bowling Green, Kentucky has changed over to. I was expecting them to change again, but not so. I have been on the patch for several years, and the ones I am getting now are messy. The medicine on the patch oozes out from around the patch and has messed up all of my underwear. I do not feel that I am getting the benefits of the medicine because it oozes from around the patch, so I would like to request that they get them from a different company. I tried to get a hold of the company on the box, but I could not pull it up. Thank you for your time.
*: They made me wait in line for an hour! The pharmacy associate was all over, entertaining other costumers when I'm the one in line. He canceled my prescription orders right away when I said I'm going to check Target (which is way much better in customer service) for availability of my meds because Walmart didn't do their job in time. Plus, they're 20 minutes past their break time, making everyone in line wait!
*: I moved my drugs from CVS Pharmacy to Wal-Mart Pharmacy and that was a huge mistake. I have bad migraines and take **. That is the only pill that works well. For 5 weeks now, they keep claiming that they are out of the ingredients. Well, if you cannot keep getting these ingredients, then why not switch places where you can get them for crying out loud. I have complained to any and everybody that will listen to me if they do not straighten this out, and then I will get the word out about the crappy service that I was handed. Thank you for anybody that will listen.
*: On December 5th, 2012, I left my doctor's office to go to the Wal-Mart Pharmacy in Fort Worth (#2978) to pick up my prescriptions that she just called in. When I got there, they told me that they prescriptions were not ready to be filled yet due to being recently filled. I contacted my insurance company, and they said what probably happened was that WM Pharmacy already filled them and was trying to charge my insurance a second time. My insurance company said that they had not been recently filled, just by that WM Pharmacy. Finally, after 2 hours of talking on the phone with my insurance company, Wal-Mart finally filled my prescriptions and I thought this was a one-time occurrence.  Then it happened again today (01/10/2012) for another prescription. I have been contacting them to work out this problem since 9am this morning. It is now 1:43 in the afternoon. I just got off the phone with my insurance and they are supposed to be contacting Wal-Mart Pharmacy. These prescriptions are time-sensitive, and in both cases, I need my medicine and Wal-Mart continues to foul things up!
*: I waited 1 1/2 hour and finally asked why my prescription was not ready and was told "Oh, they didn't tell you? We are talking with your insurance company." I was then told my son is not covered on the policy. I pointed out his name and account number on my insurance card and that he has been going to the doctor for 1 year for check-ups and the insurance is valid. I was told I could pay for my prescription and to bring the receipt back within two weeks for a refund and call my HR people. I called my employer, and they verified with the insurance company that my son was on the policy and valid. 
*: I was called and told my prescription was ready and waiting. I got to Walmart, and it was not there. They argued with me for 10 minutes saying that they had no record of my doctor calling it in. To make sure, prior to getting their call saying it was ready, I called my doc's office yesterday and she said it had been faxed to them. Finally the pharmacist called the doctor's office. They verified what I said and offered to re-fax it to Walmart. 
*: Worst service and rude staff - This is the Walmart at 1635 Market Place Boulevard, Irving, TX. They asked me to come after 30 minutes for the medicine and when I went back after 1 hour they said they didn't have the medicine. The pharmacy lady said she had nothing to talk with me and was so very rude - totally unprofessional and rude. These guys should not be in business.
*: I am not sure if this comment box has enough text to fit my complaint. Just overall, very, very unhappy with the whole entire management team at this store. Starting with the Pharmacy Dept., I have brought my complaints to the Pharmacist and to the Technicians only to get an “I’m sorry” with a look on their faces like they don't give 2 cents! As far as this pharmacy being consistent, they have managed to master it with my son. It's been clear over 5 times that they have managed to disappoint me with my son's prescriptions, who just turned 2 years old by the way.
*: I went to the Walmart in Centerville, Utah to get some bubble gum flavor in my son's pain reliever; i.e., infant fever and pain reducer. I have never had a problem with a pharmacist adding some flavor to this god awful-tasting medicine. Well, it just so happened I went in there on Sunday (11-25-12). The Pharmacist (Beverly) that was working refused to add flavor to the medicine. I explained that I come in here regularly to get this done. She informed me that she doesn't have to do anything that she doesn't want to do. I said to her, "The gentleman Kevin behind you has helped me in the past." He was so disrespectful. I cannot believe the way that Walmart treats not only their employees but their customers. I think that if more people speak up about the treatment they have received at Walmart, "maybe" things will change. I will never go back to a store, any store, and be disrespected and humiliated by rude, arrogant, disrespectful people. BTW, my son was in the cart in his car seat crying.
*: Okay, this is absolutely ridiculous. Last month, I made a complaint about the negligence of the pharmacy in Owasso, OK. This month was just another prime example of how far the customer service has fallen. My husband went to the pharmacy to fill our son's ** prescription as we do every month. Yet again, the pharmacy personnel at the drop off window was rude and negligent about verifying the correct patient information. My son is six, therefore, an adult must drop off the prescription with a valid ID. My husband presented his license and the associate began logging my husband’s information as though he is the patient. 
*: My husband was recently discharged from the hospital on multiple medications. Due to the number of scripts, the doctor said he would try to utilize as many of the $4 monthly or $10 for 3 months to lower the cost. That meant that the meds would be a 90-day supply. When I went to pick up the scripts, the pharmacy had not filled the meds according to the $10/3months, but instead had sent them through my insurance, making some of them $15 or more per month, when I was to actually get three months for $10. I asked that they take them off my insurance and fill them like they should have. I went back to get them and some of them have been filled correctly, but many have not. In fact, ** for nebulizer treatments were to be one ampule 4 times a day. I took home the meds they gave me (2 entire sackfuls.)
*: I used to pick up five different seizure medicines every month for my son but coming back and forth, I enrolled in auto-refill policy and scheduled all of his medicines on same day each month. Before my scheduled day and date, I call and ask about when his medicines will be ready for that day. My concern is to get all medicines in time as seizure medicines can't be stopped suddenly; otherwise, my son will end up in the hospital. Every time I go to pick up the medicine, two or three medicines are ready; two are either not ready or they are unable to find the prescription. I called their complaint department twice before. Every time, they apologized and resolved the issue. Yesterday, same story. One medicine was ready, three were not and for one medicine, they don't know where the prescription was. I spent almost three hours in Wal-Mart pharmacy to get all medicines for my son.
*: The pharmacist at the Holland, Ohio Walmart was rude and unprofessional. The patient notification system for medication refills is not working properly. I tried to explain what was happening, but the pharmacist did not want to hear it. I called the store manager who had to remind her to act professional with customers. The pharmacist accused me of lying about what I was trying to explain to her about the system. I was never able to resolve the issue with Walmart. I transferred my prescriptions to the Kroger Pharmacy the same day. An hour after I left the Walmart Pharmacy, I received two text messages from them telling me that my three prescriptions were ready. The system is working fine. Not.
*: I went to the doctor today and got a prescription for ** for head cold, chest cold, earache, etc., etc. I went to my local Walmart to pick up my prescription. Not feeling well, I headed home to take an antibiotic and jump in bed. I opened the bottle and found 20 large pills marked ** (the antibiotic) and 30 small tablets marked **. I called the pharmacy and spoke with the pharmacist that filled my prescription. Long story short, it was an "oops," she put 30 High Blood Pressure pills (not mine, normally my BP is on the low side) right in with my antibiotic. She asked that I return the 30 ** tablets so she could properly dispose of them. I understand people make mistakes but that is one heck of an "oops." This could have had dire consequences.
*: Been doing business with Walmart Pharmacy in Richland, MS since 2006. They have messed up a couple of times in the past. A couple of years ago, I gave them a piece of my mind and things got better. This last time, they were out of a couple of my prescriptions that I need. I had tried to get them to transfer them to another store or transferred from another store but they can't do it. I had saved up some in case something like this happened. I had to borrow from someone also. I got phone calls that they were ready. I live 26 miles away but I went anyway, they had six of one of them ready, I got them and the other 24 I got later. A few weeks later, I got the other prescription. The one where I got six and then the 24 it took up 2 refills because of time line and now I will have to go to doctor before the new year to get new refills. Called today and found out they left one of my refills off of the meds I picked up a week ago. I am changing back to Walgreens and pay the $9.95 for generic meds. I was spending an average of $50.00 (motor oil, ammo, Gro lawn supplies) extra when I went to Walmart, so I will save money in the long run.
*: Well the Walmart store in Saint Lucie West Florida is where I’m making a complaint on the pharmacy. Very rude service by a lady name **. She is a pharmacist there. I don’t know what her issue is but as I know, Walmart doesn’t stand by that. Well, I can tell I have made over 2 complaints bout her with no feedback at all. I was told 2 times that it was going to upper management and within 72 hours I will be getting a call. Well, I didn’t get that call. So I am now writing my complaint. I don’t even know if this will be read or not. So ** was very rude. She let all the other people in line with me know my business, that I have cancer, so I believe we have a HIPAA law problem and I’m going to file every thing I can file plus more. She makes it seem that she hates white people and I know so many customers know her and how she acts and they all agree I want to know why nothing has been said to her or no one has called me. 
*: I don't mind people having a bad day and coming across wrong on the phone due to just being stretched too thin. But when it happens 4 times in a row, that's not just a bad day. When I call to speak to the pharmacy at Malden, Missouri Wal-Mart, she (Brittany) is short and to the point of rude, like I'm a nuisance. I’m sorry that my business is not worth her time.
*: Bowling Green, Ohio Walmart - For 3 months straight, the pharmacist forgot to give me 1 of my meds. When it happened 1st and 2nd, it didn't bother me because I had enough. I just take it when needed but the 3rd time was too many, so I checked the bag when I got to my car. It was missing again so we walked back in. My husband explained what was going on and she went over and grabbed it right away. The big point is, it has happened 3 times and I'm very tired of having to check for their screw ups. It's supposed to be their jobs. Thank you again.
*: My girlfriend took a prescription for a vitamin wafer to Walmart in Dixon, IL. It was for 8 weeks, and they filled it for 4 weeks and said for her to come and get the rest in 4 weeks. She needs to take one tomorrow Oct 30th, so she called from work to get it refilled and they told her they were out and would have tomorrow between 10:00 and 11:00 am. No problems. I picked her up from work at 3:15 and went out for dinner. When we got home, there was a message on our phone for her to call Walmart. She did and they told her they couldn't get it and they weren't making it anymore. She would have to go to Walgreens, which is on the other side of town, and it would be a couple of dollars more plus gas. Why didn't they just fill the whole prescription at the beginning? I have had problems with them before and had to call Arkansas. These Walmart pharmacies should be closed and other pharmacies should be used. She is not taking this medicine anymore; she refuses. For the experience I put angry because it doesn't go any lower.
*: I am writing the Corporate office at Walmart in reference my visit to my local Mt. Pleasant, PA store. In addition to this complaint addressed to the corporate office, I will also be directing an email to the management team at the store level. On October 24, 2012, I visited my local store to drop off a written prescription to be filled around 9:00 am. I was the first person to be waited on in the "Drop Off LIne". This first interaction was extremely unpleasant.
*: My son is in kindergarten and in order for him to focus to get through his day, he requires **. This is a medication for ADHD. On Friday, we picked up his refill prescription slip and dropped it off at the Walmart pharmacy in Owasso, OK. My husband was told it would take 20 minutes, I then received a call stating that they did not have the medication in stock but it would be in by Tuesday. I told them that would be fine. My husband called Wednesday to find out if he could pick it up. We were then told that the medication did not come in. My husband called again on Wednesday evening to be sure that the medication did not come in, again he was told that they did not have it. On Thursday morning, once again my husband called WM pharmacy and was told that they do not have the medication.
*: My elderly mother was prescribed an antibiotic by her dentist for a tooth infection. My mother went to pick up the prescription from Wal-Mart located in Providence, Rhode Island on Silver Spring Street. When I went to visit her, I noticed a very large bottle of pills on the kitchen table. I did an internet search on the med (** 100mg) and found out it was used to treat seizures, not tooth infections! My mother had already taken two pills! Upon further investigation, it was found that Wal-Mart gave my mother someone else's medication! We returned the meds to Wal-Mart and were given a $25 gift card for the potential dangerous mistake! 
*: My daughter is on ** 50mg for headaches, and because it's working for her, her doc made the decision to up the prescription. Because I had the medication filled at Walmart in the past, I chose to go back. When I got there, I was told that it would be 30-45 minutes and the Rx would be complete. When I went back, I was told that the medication could not be filled because we had picked up a prescription on the 9th of this month (which we hadn't - she was completely out of the med when I got the new script) and that under the new Rx, she should have enough until the 23rd. When I asked if this was our insurance saying this, he stated that it wasn't and that it was their policy. I then asked to see the record of where I signed for the medication on the 9th, and he said that I had no right to see that information.
*: It seems the last few times I went to Wal-Mart to pick up a prescription, a person was at the pharmacy counter checking out some groceries. One time, I waited in the drive-thru for a long time. I finally went into the store. The lady at the pharmacy counter told me that the person in front of me at the drive-thru asked her to get some items for her that were not prescriptions. Please make prescriptions just for prescriptions. They can check the other items out through the regular checkers and have them add their prescriptions. Believe me, this will become more of a problem as time goes on!
*: Because I travel frequently, I chose Walmart Pharmacies in order to receive necessary refills anywhere in the country. For the past year, I have had nothing but bad experiences with Walmart pharmacists in Arizona, Texas, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Kentucky, and Hawaii - lost paperwork, erroneous messages, mislabeled containers, wrong medications, miscounted pills, and delayed refills. Not once was a prescription filled correctly and on time, and I never once received an apology. I have transferred all my prescriptions and no longer shop at any Walmart store, but I keep getting automated phone messages saying my medications will be returned to stock if not picked up.
*: I just went to pick up three meds which had been faxed this morning. However, they only got one. This always seems to be their excuse. I just changed from Walgreens to Wal-Mart because of my Medicare prescription drug plan. Well, I love Walgreens and will most likely change back to them. I have never had a good experience with the pharmacy at Wal-Mart. Just saying!
*: I was out of insulin for 3 days. Walmart is saying it couldn't be filled, it was too early. Then it was my insurance that wouldn't cover it, I'd have to pay the full price, which is over $200. Then it was my doctor's fault that they couldn't fill it! I switched to Walgreens and it was filled in an hour. All Walgreens did was pick up a phone and call my insurance company. Walmart pharmacy is just lazy.
*: In a time when large box stores, like Wal-Mart, offer sanitary wipes to wipe the handles of shopping carts, it is ludicrous to me that the pharmacy counter doesn't offer hand sanitizer for credit card customers. Of all the people who make purchases at the pharmacy counter, some are sick with illnesses that may be passed on to the next customer who touches the pen device that the sick person has used. Germ transfer to a pen can't be stopped, but the pen could be wiped or hand sanitizer can be available so that another's germs will not pass on an illness.
*: I called Wal-Mart to order a prescription. When I went in to pick it up, they tried to tell me I had already picked it up. I explained that I had not and maybe they misplaced it there somewhere. After some convincing, the pharmacy manager gave me my prescription but didn't charge me because she said my insurance had already been charged. I was a little confused but left. A week later, I get a letter in the mail from Wal-Mart corporate. Wal-Mart had given out my prescription and bottle with my medicine, name, address, and phone number to another customer! The customer apparently noticed after a few days that he had someone else's medication and returned it. Furious, I called Wal-Mart corporate and left a message. Two days later, I finally got a call from their PR dept. She apologized, but I'm horrified that this guy in my small town knows where I live, my name, number, and medication. I threatened to stop going there and the PR lady did not try to convince me otherwise. I think they should have at least offered a measly gift card or something for such a violation of my privacy.
*: I had ordered my seizure medicine (they do not keep it in stock) and was not able to pick it up on the due date, but I was there the next day. They had given my medicine to someone else who took the same thing I do. That left me with 6 pills from them, and I was told they would have more tomorrow. My husband went off and asked them if they wanted to talk to our attorney. My medicine was very important for me to have. They gave him a $20.00 gift card and told him my medicine would be there tomorrow. If I had ordered the medicine, why was it not already put up for me? I quit going there once, but I thought I would give it another try.
*: I stopped to buy an antihistamine at my neighborhood Wal-Mart center. I am unfamiliar with this pharmacy. However, there were 5 or 6 people behind a counter and a lady standing on the outside of the counter. I moved to the counter to simply ask where to look for the intended product when a pharmacy worker snapped, "Get behind the line!" I had no idea what she was saying as she was facing the rear of the pharmacy, and she was hanging sacks of some sort. She was mumbling. I said, "Excuse me?" She snapped again. Finally, the lady customer laughingly pointed to an obscure 2 foot by 1 inch faded line four feet behind me. I asked the employee if she was talking to me, and she finally turned to my direction, and nastily said, "Yes!" Up to that very moment, I had no idea that I had broken any national security laws or federal mandates. She said, "Get behind the line!" I was embarrassed, somewhat confused, and beginning to feel an angry response in myself. 
*: I went to pick up my refill. But since they canceled my last refill and I did not call in, the pharmacy’s male staff asked me to wait for 30 minutes in order for him to prepare the refill, and it's no problem for me. Until suddenly a female staff interrupted unfriendly and told him that she would handle the service for me. And so bizarre… suddenly she told me that the refill vitamin for my child is not available and I have to pick up the next day. The pharmacy at Wal-Mart Westbury has no professional customer service at all. Most of them are rude, totally the opposite with Wal-Mart Massapequa.
*: I've had so many bad experiences with Wal-Mart pharmacy. I've just decided to stop going there. The only reason I continued this long is because they are so convenient to my home but it's really not worth it. They have poor, rude staff (and the manager allows it) and give out wrong prescriptions (if they can find it at all). I dropped off a prescription over a month ago. I gave them the bottle with one refill left and they were supposed to transfer it from another pharmacy. Well, one month later and still no prescription, I called them on my way home from work one afternoon. Lo and behold, the person told me to hold and just hung up on me. 
*: Substandard service: Double billing for Medicare items, selling food on the floor, rude behavior by pharmacist, lack of action by store manager, and repeatedly bad service by the pharmacy.
*: I was at Altoona, LA when my refill ran out so I went to the Super Center to get it refilled and the person told me that I would have to get another script from the doctor. I took the original bottle with me and she looked up my information and it said I have 1 refill left. So I had to go without it for several days until I got home and they filled it with no problem. I spent several thousand dollars a year and thought Wal-Mart would be able to fill my needs because we travel a lot, but Walgreens will get it from now on.
*: In May 2012, my doctor called in a prescription of ** to my local Wal-Mart. That evening, I went into Wal-Mart and was told by the girl at the front desk that I needed to go to the drop-off window, because there was no prescription ready for me. This person named Anna, the pharmacy manager, told me that there was no prescription called in for me. From May until July 10, 2012, I have been trying to get the medication filled. Finally today, after the 17th call to my doctor's office, I placed a call to Wal-Mart and was told the prescription was ready. I was told that the prescription was ready since May, after being repeatedly told there was no prescription on several occasions by Anna, the pharmacy manager. I had to purchase over-the-counter **. I had a great deal of suffering due to nausea, vomiting, and reflux; because I did not have my medication. I spoke with a manager today who told me that Wal-Mart made the error that they had a pharmacist who came in that night and cancelled the order because of insurance reasons.
*: I was at the doctor too long to get my prescription filled that night. My husband dropped it off in the morning. I went to work sick. I tried to pick it up 4 hours after he dropped it off. I stood in line for quite a while just for them to tell me it wasn't ready yet. They had put mine at the back of the line. My husband took his time & spent gas to get there so I would not have to wait when I was able to get it. I do not appreciate it. This is not the first time this has happened to me. I will no longer use your pharmacy!
*: On June 13, 2012, I picked up a name brand medication I have been on for over 20 years and noticed on the paperwork a handwritten note. Upon asking the checkout clerk and the onsite pharmacist, I was told this store (#0076) could no longer order this medicine per instructions from Walmart Headquarters, plus the prescription was 15 pills short. The checkout clerk even suggested I call my doctor and get a prescription for a new medication. That same day I called the complaint line 479-273-4000. Now, it is two weeks and four calls later and I have yet to hear from anyone about my complaint. The third call (6-21-2012), went to the supervisor assistance line and I was told an "urgent" e-mail would be sent to the district managers, Randal **, marketing and Leslie **, regional. The main pharmacist, **, at this local store, is also trying to get some answers and as of 6-21-2012, submitted a required form, which is all she can do.
*: Last week, I called in my prescriptions and when I went to pick up the medicine, they had me ** 1.50 and 1.75. I only take 1.50, so after waiting in line way too long, they had to make a correction which took another 20 minutes. Yesterday, I called in two more prescriptions and told them we would pick it up this morning. We got there and they had me ** 1.75 again, which had to be corrected. I sat at the drive-up window for 20 minutes before they ever even asked if they could help us. Then they had to correct their error and that was another 15 minutes, all the time telling me they are covered up and they will get to me as soon as they can. 
*: Today makes two months in a row that Walmart can't fill my prescription because they are out of the drug.
*: I phoned in for my prescription as I do every 3 months. I asked if they had the generic brand as they have not had it for the last 3 times that I have gone and got my prescription. The pharmacist said no, they didn't have the generic brand, so I said “I will take the regular one then.” So she put me on hold and came back on about 3 or 4 minutes later and said they had none of that either. Then I asked, “So do you have an idea when you'll be getting more in, because I need to change my appointment with the doctor who has to administer it.” She said nope and said, “You'll have to find another pharmacy that has the same and get your account transferred.” Needless to say, I am not very happy with Walmart! Not the fact that they ran out, it's the customer service I got, it was terrible. But then again, who am I kidding? It is never a pleasant experience when I go there!
*: They filled my wife's Rx and that night at about 2 am, my wife got a bad, bad headache. She started throwing up for 30 minutes. Her head hurt so bad she could not get up. The machine to check her blood sugar would only register high results. She took a shot and at 5:00am, she took it again. Then, she went to a diabetes coma. I could not help but check print out and it says do not take if you have diabetes. For help, it said call doctor. What a joke. He knew she had diabetes but still wrote Rx. The name is ** 20 mg. There was neither warning on the bottle nor pharmacist let her know she could not take it. What's wrong there? 
*: When I call and leave things on voice mail, it takes a while to get the scripts filled. If I try to talk to a pharmacist, I am put on hold for 5 or 10 minutes. Your phone system puts you to silence. You really do not know if you are still connected. Other pharmacies have noise - music or something. You used to and it wasn't so bad. Please reinstate the music to your call system so that we wait with sound not silence. This is a corporate problem, not just one store.
*: I was given the incorrect stomach meds but got home before I figured this out. When I went back, I was told I had to get it pre-approved. But my doctor's office did pre-approve. I went back again to pick up and was given the wrong script again. When I came back in, I was told it had to be mail ordered. My insurance does not support mail order. They looked at their computer and said, "But it says right here!" I called my insurance and had them contact Wal-Mart to fix. Still, they did not. They told me the doctor only called in 15 days.
*: I call for refill for my medicine on Saturday, June 2, 2012. Then I said to the pharmacy call attendant that I will pick the medicine Sunday, June 3, 2012. I am on ODSP and I got severe pain in my neck and back. I have no strength to keep myself stay for a longer time. The salesgirl kept me waiting. Even though I told the pharmacist all the story that I take this medicine same every month. There is no new medicine requested. I gave her my drug as usual. Still, they kept me waiting for 45 minutes for nothing. They’re dealing with other customers. For this happening, I got mentally disturbed and had severe neck and back pain. I ask you people, who will be responsible for this negligence if I get some more serious problem? I request to inquire about this matter and this should not happen to anybody. Thanks.
*: I was given the wrong medication. When I returned the medication, I was told that the right medication would not given. I was told to keep the wrong medication, even though I had that medication which made me ill. My regular pills were little yellow pills; I was given little white pills. They gave me my regular pills to last a few days. The supervisor was not very nice.
*: I had a very bad experience in the Wyncote, PA Walmart Store on 1000 Easton Rd. I picked up the wrong testing stripes for my ReliOn Meter. After leaving the store and coming home, I noticed I had the wrong strips. I went back to the store and tried to get the right ones. I was told by the counter clerk (black female in early 20s) that no blood testing items could be returned. I asked to speak to the manager of the Pharmacy. A woman by the name of ** stated that the policy of Walmart was not to accept returns on blood testing supplies. I then tried to purchase the correct strips and she instructed me to take them to the front of the store to ring out although she had registers in her location for purchases. 
*: I went to the pharmacy yesterday here in Marlin, TX, and they were out of Ultra One Touch testing strips. I called on the phone today and asked if they were in and was told yes. I went to the pharmacy and asked for Ultra One Touch strips. The little girl, who waited on me, said, "Oh yes, I talked to you on the phone. She got the strips and rang them up, and I paid for them, noticing, even mentioning to the clerk that they had gone way down on the price." 
*: I had a problem with my prescription and the tech was trying to be very helpful. She also had a problem solving my problem, so she called Cindy the pharmacist over to help. She was rude and told the tech to call my insurance company, which the tech did. When the tech was finished with the phone call, she again asked Cindy to look over the computer. Cindy was rude and told me her tech does not have time to call every customer’s insurance company. I did not tell the tech to call, she did. I hope she is nicer to other customers. She did not believe me that the doctor was on my previous script and it was not filled at Wal-Mart. I told her I got my last one in SC. She replied sarcastically that she doesn't have a license to practice in SC.
*: I picked up my father's prescription, and it was short the full quantity. I made a complaint and have not received a call. I called several times and sent an e-mail, but no one responded.
*: I dropped off the prescription at outside drop off. A week later, I had not heard if it had been filled. I went by to pick it up and they had lost it.
*: I transferred a generic prescription not on the $4 list. When I looked it up, the disclaimer popped up that it was not a generic. Wrong! I have been taking it for years and it is a generic for ** (a calcium channel blocker). It seems that someone in your organization needs to do a little more research. I did get it for $4 at Walmart for several years when I first started taking it.
*: I got a partial prescription from Wal-Mart of an 8-day generic supply because the name brand wasn't in stock. I asked them to order the rest of my 30-day supply and they said they would have it within one day. I gave them extra time in case it took longer than they said. When I went to pick up the rest of my prescription, they said they couldn't because my insurance already gave me an 8-day supply. I talked to the doctor about this and he wrote me another script to get another ordered ASAP. When I went and hand it in, they said I couldn't get it because of the insurance company already gave me an 8-day supply. I went to two different pharmacies and they told me they couldn't do that. 
*: First of all, the dosage on one prescription has been wrong for over 6 months. I had been using it twice a day instead of only once a day as the doctor slip said. I called them about it today, 5-15-12. I had it checked with my doctor on my last visit and verified it. Second, I have been trying to get my blood pressure prescription refilled by them for 1 and a half weeks. Now that it’s out, all they can say is that they faxed it to doctor’s office and the doctor’s office said they did not get any faxes. And as of today and three more phone calls, they still have not gotten my prescription ready. If I have a stroke from my blood pressure going up from being out of my RX, someone is getting their ** sued. Walmart store in Keokuk, Iowa.
*: I had a coinstar slip. I asked the person at the desk if I could use it in the pharmacy. Yes was the reply, so I went to the pharmacy and the young lady looked at it and said that she didn't know how to use it. The other salesclerk said that she had to key in manually and she sneered her face up and acted like she was doing it and said that she could not do it and gave me the prescription and the slip. She said that I had to go to the front desk, so I asked the other young lady if she could do it and she told me that the hand screeners was down and that she couldn't either. So I went and stood in line at checkout and the young lady graciously helped me out. The other young lady needs to learn or find someone in pharmacy to help or show her how it is done. It's a waste of brain cells.
*: I have filled my prescriptions at Wal-Mart in Lewisville, TX (801 West Main st.) for several years now. I have had more problems with them saying insurance doesn't cover this or that, when I know it does. I also have had problems with them giving me 30-day supply when I have 90-day supply. The staff is usually ambivalent and disinterested in helping and assisting you. I have found them very unprofessional, rude, and unfriendly. I won't be going there any longer because of their lack of customer service. In addition, I'm always having to wait extended periods of time for my prescriptions.
*: My family has been using the same Wal-Mart pharmacy for 20-plus years. The pharmacy has only gotten a few of my orders right. We spend about $200 to $300 in just co-pay each month. There are several problems: wrong order and wrong price; they’re not ready or they don’t carry the meds; and they submit wrong insurance, over price, and others! I have talked to the store manager who does not work. I have called the pharmacy’s DIV manager who will not respond! The last straw was last week. I placed an order. They called and said they do not have amount on hand and would fill when order can be in from the distributor. Well, they just called and said their distributor did not have it in stock. They said to come in, get a prescription and place it with Rite Aid. This prescription is for a well-known pain med, which I have been taking 3 times a day for several years. The only reason I use Wal-Mart is because one-stop shopping saves gas! I am not a happy camper.
*: I have been getting my prescriptions at Wal-Mart off & on (mostly on) for over 10 years. I get 8 medications plus supplies on part D & 7 medications on Workers Company. I have tried so hard to keep these 2 separate, so that there is as little confusion as possible? But it does no good, because without fail, they mix them up, so I have to wait there for them to adjust the cost. So, a quick trip for my medications has now turned into a 30-45-minute wait?
*: My daughter called me today after her appt. with Dr. Lisa **, Reno, NV and told me that Walmart Pharmacy on Pyramid Hwy in Sparks had wrongly filled her prescription. This was discovered by Dr. ** and her nurse as my daughter had her medication with her at the appt., with the wrong dosage on the bottle. The pharmacy was called at that time by the nurse and this was discussed. My daughter said this was upsetting to the doctor. This is terrible. My daughter said that she dealt with heart palpitations for a period of time unnecessarily because of this wrong dose. When she called me she was upset and scared at the unnecessary danger and suffering that this error cost her, and I'm terribly upset by this too. She also said she always faced rudeness from that pharmacy. How awful. My daughter deserves an apology and a discussion on your financial help with her extra lab and doctor's appt. that this error will cost. Can you blame me for my anger? 
*: I called in a refill for one of my prescriptions, then went online to see the status. It showed my co-pay as $7.25; yet, when I received the automated call letting me know that it was ready, my price quoted was the normal $9. I was a bit confused. I went in and got my medication, and again, I was quoted $9. I asked why it showed online that it was $7.25 and yet, I was paying higher. I got an "I don't know. You will have to go to the dropoff line and ask there"!
*: My doctor calls Walmart Pharmacy every month for them to fill out what he wants for me but when I go there, first, they can't find the medication and then if they do find it, then it is filled out wrong name and amount. Sometimes they just transfer my old medications from 2011 and try to sell them to me. I have gone 3 days in a row and not only have they filled the wrong meds, they were very rude, lied, and made me a look a liar and yelled at me. Two years ago, I asked them to update my information and since then, I have asked them over 20 times and have given then my driver license to update but still they have ignored it and have not updated my name yet. 
*: My neighborhood Wal-Mart Pharmacy Cooper City, FL never has my prescription medication in stock. When I attempt to leave the prescription until the medication can be ordered, certain pharmacists refuse to accept it. They state it is considered a controlled substance and do not want the responsibility of holding it until the medication is available. I would then have to continue to call daily and inquire if they have the medication. They cannot tell me when they will have the medication in stock. 
*: The new system Wal-Mart has devised for the pharmacy is not working. It takes 3 times longer to get a prescription refilled than it use to. I called my prescription in on a Thursday and at 7:00 pm on the following Saturday, it was still not completely filled and I had to wait. Then, the worker could not find one of them because the system is crazy. Why did you change something that was working okay? Many people in Columbus have told me the same thing and the pharmacy workers don't like the system either. Do something, please!
*: My boyfriend has been very sick and was rushed to the ER. After his release, the nurse had specifically instructed that it was very important that he fill and start taking the prescribed medication today. We rushed to Wal-Mart, and after standing in line for a quite a long time, the pharmacist / technician proceeded to ignore us. After finally getting her attention, she informed us she was going to lunch in 15 minutes and that the prescription wouldn't even be started till 3pm. It was noon then, and he knew he couldn't wait that long. 
*: Dear negative thread posters, let me post some questions for you and feel free to respond. How many of you are on Medicaid/Fidelis (big difference) or Medicare? Do you know that the taxpayers foot the bill for you? Do you know that the pharmacy staff, who is working only to watch you waive your co-pays or complain about $1.10 co-pay for stuff that costs $500, pay taxes so you can have this? Do you realize that you get free ** all the time, but you still have the audacity to complain about your 5-mile drive or 25-minute wait?
*: Over the last 10 months, the level of service at the Blytheville store has declined to a sub-standard level. I am notified via the phone that my meds are ready. Then I drove 20 miles, only to be greeted by one of the following: your meds are not ready, it will another 30+ minutes; we can only give you a partial amount; or we are unable to fill the prescription, come back. 
*: I submitted a prescription with a discount from doctor. It was $243. I couldn't afford it that day. I went back two days later, April 2. It was now $700. They told me the discount card from doctor was expired. There has been a complication every time I had a script filled at Wal-Mart. The pharmacy sends texts when scripts are ready. It is never ready and there's a 2-hour wait and most of the staff (not all) are rude and patronizing.
*: I am very displeased with the phone line service with the pharmacy area. I have had my prescriptions messed up every time I go to pick them up in the last six months and I am very upset about it. I call them in like I am supposed to and it either drops one or all of them. Yesterday, I called them in I had one on hold so I had to talk to the pharmacy person and they told they were all ready and they would fill the one on hold and have it ready too. This was around 12:00 pm. Everything was supposed to be ready at 1:00 pm. I get there a 5:30 pm and nothing is ready again. Last time I waited and got in line which was long three different times and still were not ready. So this time, I let them know I would be back. Today, I was in waiting again. Come on, I called them in at 7 am and they're not ready. Why pick a time if your store can't keep their word? 
*: I am a user of ** 50mg and have been for years. My complaint is the current packaging. They come in the blue plastic container with bubble type individual holders. My problem is I am an 80 year old with arthritic fingers and these pills are very hard to extricate from the holders. My husband used to take the very same pill, which came in a pill vial (from another pharmacy though). Why cannot Walmart get them in a similar vial? This is very frustrating.
*: I can understand when you are temporarily out of an item that I wish to buy, but when that same item is not in stock for several weeks, it places me in a position where I have to go to another store. My personal complaint has to do with empty shelves in the frozen juices section and in the OTC shelves in the pharmacy. While shopping this morning, I noticed that those aren't the only shelves with no products. Could it be that those items have been out of stock for long periods too? While visiting a store in another town, I find that those same items are on the shelves there. This is an inconvenience that requires me to either go to a Wal-Mart in another town or to a competitor locally.
*: I called in a refill and never received a call that it was ready. When I went to pick it up, they had already put it back in inventory. I asked them to fill it again. The next morning, I went to pick it up and it was an old prescription that had been replaced by the new one. They refused to fill it, while I waited after they inconvenienced me twice. They said it will take an hour and a half. I filled prescriptions myself for a decade, and I know it can be done in less then 5 minutes. I am now waiting to go back to get it, missing work and losing income. Their attitude was very poor, rude, and robotic.
*: Walmart's lack of knowledge in dealing with Medicare & Supplemental  - I am a senior with Medicare coverage Part A & Part B. Additionally I purchase Supplemental Health Care from BCBS. My Medicare supplemental coverage is Plan F that covers deductible and co-insurance for all Part A and for all Part B.
*: They have attitude. I have asked for over a year to get all my scripts at one place and not be told to go somewhere else. This a pharmacy where you can get any med you want to be delivered to you if you can't find one or a supplier to get them. That is the same with servings for B12 you can't get. You get plenty of excuses and no products. Why, why? They just don't care! 
*: My name is William ** (MSG/E-8 Retired). I am a 29 year U.S. Army, 100% retired, on permanent and total disability. I went to my doctor in Junction City, KS to get my normal medicines. They were mostly partially filled and one of my Parkinson meds. I received 12, had them called in and took my C-2 with prescription. They gave me a partial fill (12 pills) instead of 100. I am traveling to Los Angeles for knee replacement. It took 3 visits; I paid and received 9 pills. They called me and your automated told me it was ready. I went to the Wal-Mart, prec # ** and they asked me to wait another 20 or 30 minutes. Wrong answer. I filled out approximately 5 surveys from the Department of Defense about vets health issues, prescriptions, just ** service in general. My question is, "Do you want my business or do I need to call someone." Your call.
*: For 4 months now, I had to get a refill on my **. And every time, there is a problem with not getting a fax or call from my doctor. The employees don't care or have a clue what is going on. They never have the right fax or phone numbers. They say they don't get faxes or calls and I just called my doctor's office and they just sent it! I even had one lady working on the computer that acted like she might go to sleep at any moment! She said she had taken too much cold medicine. The only one that I could get to help me was a man named Travis. I think they should look at the employees better and their phone system! 
*: They need more help or better management! I have back pain and I was out of my medication again. So I went to get my script filled for the month at Wal-Mart in Red Bluff, CA. I had to wait 2 days to 3 days later. My question is this, **?
*: I bought a box of Equate **, which contains 3 bottles inside, each containing 14 pills. When I opened the first bottle of medication, it appeared that one of the capsules had broken, therefore powder was throughout the entire bottle but yet, I couldn't see any broken capsules. Because this is a somewhat expensive medication, I ignored the problem and used the medication anyways. 
*: I am an insulin dependent diabetic. Last month, when I went to have my prescription filled for my insulin, they only had 2 of the 3 bottles on my monthly prescription but I had to pay the same for 2 bottles as for 3 bottles. Since I am a senior and have prescription D coverage, that wasn't such a big deal. But this month when I went to pick up my prescription, they were totally out of the insulin I use but said that they had their own brand but I would have to pay the full price on their insulin. I am on a fixed income and paying full price is a hardship for me. This makes me wonder if I'm going to have problems every time I go. If they can't order enough insulin, I will have to change my prescription to another pharmacy. I would like to know if this is going to be a problem every time I go to fill this prescription.
*: I was unable to get through to a pharmacist to call in a prescription at store #5881 in Springfield, PA. I did not want to leave a message given the nature of the prescription. After four calls, I spoke with an assistant manager who said she'd have a pharmacist call me back. I am still awaiting a return call. I intend to encourage all of my patients to avoid Wal-Mart pharmacies, which I will do personally as well since I refuse to spend this much time to provide you with business.
*: My doctor had called in a refill for my ** for blood sugar and my ** for fluid tablets. I went in to pick them up at the Olney, IL store. The young girl with purple hair couldn't find my order. She went to call my doctor and came back to ask for doctor's name and address the second time. Then she came back and asked for my name for the second time, left the area, came back for the third time to ask my name. She finally came back and told me they were working on my order, but I should give them 24 hours to fill an order. What kind of pharmacy operates on a 24-hour notice to fill an order? I have been using Walmart pharmacy for years, but after leaving without my pills, I am very disappointed. I now have to drive back to Olney tomorrow to pick them up. I am glad I have enough pills left, but I am really concerned about other customers who might need to have their orders filled the same day by someone who couldn't at least remember a name for more than 2 minutes. Hope the right pills are ready.
*: Wal-Mart in Iowa Falls, Iowa was the pharmacy which we used for our brother's medication on a monthly basis. The process was pretty routine--ordering his medications every month. The problems started when the pharmacy was unable to provide all the subscriptions at one time and making the family ran over to the pharmacy several times to get all the pills. This has continued, and the pills seldom all get filled at one time. This is a big inconvenience to family members, as it is 10 miles each way and we also have our own families to care for.
*: My doctor called in a prescription to Walmart about 2 hrs before I went to the store. When I arrived at the pharmacy, I waited in line for about 10 minutes. The cashier told me they did not get it. I checked with my doctor’s office and was told it was sent over 2 hrs before. I stood in line again and was told they had found the prescription and it would be ready in 35 minutes. I told them I would not be back. Thank you very much.
*: Me and my girl friend went to Walmart to get a script of prenatal vitamins and we were told that the script needs to be approved and that they were getting right on that and that it would only be an hour. Well, the hour came and went so we go back to the counter and ask about the script and they said the same thing. So, we left without the script. Three days later, we went back again. We waited a couple of hours and still nothing. They said that they have to call the doctor about the script. Remember, now this is for the vitamins, nothing else. So, we left without anything again. 
*: This past Thursday I was brave enough to try to get my medication from my local Wal-Mart. I say brave enough because it seems on some days that all the pharmacy people at my Wal-Mart do not want to help customers. February 11, I was confused about a co-pay. I was real sick and doctor ordered me some meds. Instead of trying to help me and listen to my concern, I was hushed. January 12, I went with a friend to get her meds. We stood there and stood there while a pharmacy worker put on bags. We stood there and stood there. At one point my friend looked at me and said, “What the heck." I said, “Welcome to the White House, TN pharmacy.” Finally, the girl came over without a smile or a hello and took care of us even though you could tell she didn’t want to. 
*: The wrong prescription was filled. I take .08 ** shots weekly. For the past month, I have been sick and on antidemocratic so I had to wait to take my shots. The other day I went to take it and opened a new package of syringes to discover they were the wrong ones. Apparently, they had given me 3CC syringes instead of 1CC syringes. They even spelled syringes wrong as "singinge"! This happened at Wal-Mart Pharmacy # 2554 in Avondale, AZ (623-935-4010). I checked with my doctor who informed me the pharmacy made the wrong mistake. I called Wal-Mart Pharmacy and was told, "Oh well, you paid for it, so you are stuck with it!” I will not use them any more as this is very dangerous.
*: I called to check an order as I do 3 or 4 times a month and she was very rude. Some months it takes 3 days or longer to get the meds so I go to Lifecheck. They are always nice and only take a few hours as most. Uvalde Walmart is bad; I have used other Walmarts and they were good.
*: Every month, I get a 30 day prescription and every month I call it in 2 to 3 days ahead to make sure I have it on hand. I called it in on 2/29/12 and it was up 3/3/12. On 3/1/12, I called to pick it up and was told they can't fill it until the prescription is up because of the type of medicines. I never had a problem in the past (filling it) ahead 2 or 3 days. I do this because of my work and can't get to the pharmacy. I explained this to the pharmacy tech. and his statement was "this is a controlled substance and if you have a problem, you can just take it to another pharmacy". If this is your policy, then why haven't I had a problem before? Just because someone maybe on this type of med, doesn't make them an addict and shouldn't be treated as such in his words and tone with me.
*: A few years ago, I went into the Wal-Mart Pharmacy and was humiliated and made to feel as though I was some low-life junkie. Well, it started with me handing the pharmacist a valid script from my doctor of ** (25 mg). She looked at it and quickly and literally threw it back at me on the counter, stating these exact words: "This is a controlled substance, and we're out of stock anyway!" 
*: I have been using the Wal-Mart Pharmacy for years and the service within the last six months has gone down hill. The clerks are rude, the lines are long and the prescriptions are lost. According to my physician's office out of the 15-plus prescriptions they fax daily, they usually have to re-fax 5. Do they only have one fax machine? This is not just happening to me. It has happened to my wife and my parents on numerous occasions. Maybe they need to hire more staff? I have other pharmacies available to me and if this is not addressed, I will have to give my service to them.
*: I filled a prescription for **, back in December, along with my ** of 30mg and 60mg, since I am on 90mg a day dosage. At the time I filled, since I have never had a problem, I did not count out all 90 days of pills. I started to run low on the **, forgetting that I filled at the same time I did the **. I got down to the last pill, and I called Wal-Mart Pharmacy, so that they could fax my doctor about a refill. I called later in the day, to ask if they have heard anything, and they said no. I noticed I had a refill on the same medication from when I was in Florida in November, and had to have a 30 day refill transferred to Walgreens. I tried to fill it at Walgreens, but they said that I have a 90 day prescription on file someplace else, and they can't refill it. That's when I realize that I had filled these prescriptions all on the same date, and I had pills missing. A good month's worth of pills.
*: The pharmacist Nicole ** was very not understanding to my fiance because he needed to get his prescription 2 days early, which has never been a problem before. I have been having seizures for almost five months now and have only been running tests on my brain. I have to be submitted into the hospital by my doctor on Tuesday the 28th of February and my fiance has to go with me. I can't make it though this without him and he's so stressed out because I still don't know what's causing these symptoms and we can't take our children so we had to find a babysitter.
*: Please note that this is an on going harassment and threats from the manager, Reggie, at the Walmart pharmacy. This manager, Reggie of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza Mall, has taken the role of a doctor instead of a pharmacist. On Tuesday February 21, 2012, I went to pick up my prescription. I recently came home from the hospital after having surgery. Anyway when I got to the pharmacy, the cashier was looking for my prescription, and it wasn't the usual place, to pick up after a prescription is ready. The cashier said, “My computer is saying that your prescription is ready.” I said, “Yes, I know. I call the automated system and it said my prescription was ready too.”
*: I bought Equate brand ** extra strength 400.  When I opened to bottle the capsules were labels 125 returned them and will not take them. I am concerned that the wrong pills were in the bottle. Can you please explain what happened please. I would like someone to check to make sure the drug in the bottle is what the package says.
*: I take ** insulin. I inject 60 units per day. This means I need one complete box of **, since they come in a box of 5 pens, and 1 extra pen for a total of 6 pens per month. My Wal-Mart here in Bonner Springs, refuses to give me the 6 pens, saying it is their policy not to open a second box, so I have to get my medicine every 25 days, instead of 30 or 31. That means I either drop my dosage down to 50 units per day, or I pay a double co-pay for my insurance. I cannot afford to pay this. I am sure I am not the only one taking this medication for diabetes. Why is Wal-Mart doing this to consumers? I am forced to buy a 3 month supply, in order to survive. It may not seem a lot to Wal-Mart, but doing the 3 months puts a lot of stress on our budget. Please figure this out, and stop your stores from doing this to people. The pens are good for over 2 years, so they won't expire when the box is broken.
*: I have visited the Wal-Mart pharmacy four times, and each time, something has been wrong. I will mention few of the most notable issues.
*: An antibiotic was called in for my daughter before 3 pm. Another prescription was called in for her at 3 pm. We went to pick the prescription up after 6 pm, but it was not filled, and we were told that they had not even checked the recordings. After waiting for another hour and a half, she was given one prescription, but not the antibiotic. By this time, they were closing the pharmacy and she will now have to wait another day before getting her antibiotic filled.
*: My physician called days ago to fill a prescription at the Wal-Mart on Beach Blvd. Jacksonville, FL. The doctor had to call back a second time, because the prescription wasn't right. When the doctor talked to someone at Wal-Mart, they said they have everything they needed to fill the prescription. I went a second time to pick it up. The girl at the counter was rude, and said my doctor didn't call in the prescription right, and they couldn't fill it. My doctor called for the third time today, and said she gave all the info they could need. Again, they said it wasn't correct. So, I spoke to the pharmacy manager. I told him what has happened, and of course, he offered to fix the issue. I told him if he offered me the prescription free for the rest of my life, I would not take it. I will never use the Wal-Mart pharmacy again!
*: My wife has been on a sleeping pill to help her sleep through the consent pain she is in. At the start of the week, she called in her prescription to be filled. They said they did not have it as stock at the moment but would have it in soon. She has called several times to see if they had gotten it in but it did not come in until today (Thursday). I went to pick up this prescription but could not get it due to the price jumping several times what we had been paying for it. I am getting tired of prescription meds not being in stock and not being filled when called in and I would have been able to hold off paying a bill for a couple of days to get this med if I had been told that the price had gone from $27 to $70, which I find is a ridiculous price increase.
*: I talked to the pharmacy on Thursday to refill my medication. I was told it would be ready to pick up Sat. by 11 am. Saturday around noon, I stopped to get it on my way out of town. It wasn't ready. I was told it would be ready in 20 minuets. I didn't have time to wait so I told them I'd be back later. So today is Monday. I went to pick it up again. Now, it's not going to be ready until later today or maybe tomorrow. This is unacceptable. I am looking for a mail order prescription company so I will not have to deal with the incompetent people you have working at the Parker, AZ Walmart. 
*: The bottom line is, I t tried to get my asthma inhaler refilled with 2 refills available, and the pharmacist wouldn't do it. They said I just had one done a week before. I tried to explain that I had been sick and I've been using it more than normal. She said she didn't care and that I needed to call the doctor. My point here is that I had two refills available and she wouldn't do it. I complained to the store manager. He basically said he agreed with the pharmacist. (Since when is a Walmart store manager a doctor?) He did nothing. Her name is Mickey and His name is Jarod from Arroyo Grande Walmart. This pharmacy is horrible at customer service, This is not the first time she has given me a very hard time about my medications. My doctor did okay the refill!
*: I went, and was told the pharmacy was closed for lunch on Sunday. I came back and they still weren't open. When they finally opened, I was told my prescription was being filled, and it would take a couple of hours or so. I told her it was called in, way before they were even open. A man behind me screamed, "oh my God!" At that point, I was afraid for my life. people shouldn't feel this way, picking up a prescription, that is supposed to be filled. When Lisa got back from the pharmacist, she told me to wait and that it would be filled in a few minutes. This happens all the time. There are lines of people inside and out. They lie to you. I have had prescriptions sent from my doctor in the past to them, and they claim they never received it. My doctor says it gives them comp. They received it. I'm tired of the lies.
*: I had 3 prescriptions filled on Tues., January 31, 2012. One was for 20 ** 875-125 tablets, an antibiotic to take twice a day for 10 days. After 2 or 3 days, I noticed that the tablets were "flaking". When I returned the medicine to the pharmacy today, Feb. 4th and showed Jim **, the pharmacist on duty, he said it appeared that the pills had gotten wet. I told him that was not possible because I had kept them in my kitchen cabinet until I brought them back to the store. When asked if their effectiveness had been affected, he said, "Yes." He was not willing to replace my medicine, so the Shift Manager, Mr. Steven **, was called in. Mr. Steven was very professional and tried to correct the situation. However, Mr. Jim seemed to have the deciding voice in some areas. The final outcome was that I was given only 10 of the 20 pills of the prescription and I will have to return on Monday to hopefully get the remaining 10 pills from Pharmacy Manager, Tristan **, who was not there today. 
*: I phoned in two refill orders for my wife on Wed, Feb. 1, 2012. I was told that the orders would be filled by 8:30 the next day. I went to pick them up on Friday, Feb. 3, 2012. When I went to pick them up, I was told that they were not ready. I had to wait 45 minutes to get the meds. I feel that this is a short fall by the staff at store 635. I can understand having to wait if I brought in the scripts or empty bottles, but having to wait for my orders to be filled when I phoned them in 2 days in advance was uncalled for.
*: My physician called Wal-Mart Oakdale, LA and by doctor's order called in ** 9mg to take 1 at bedtime. Paul ** told my dad he was going to overnight it and it would be in today 2/2/2012). I also called Joseph ** and he said he would do all he could to make certain it would be in on 2/2/2012. I talked to Paul today on 2/2/2012 and he told me it would me in tomorrow. 
*: Re: Neighborhood Wal-Mart at Vickery Blvd, Fort Worth, TX 76116
*: Yesterday, January 30, 2012 around 4:00 pm in Burlington, Ontario (Fairview), I dealt with the worst pharmacist.  He was rude and arrogant.  He told me straight out that he does not have to be courteous to anyone; customer service policy includes Wal-Mart employees only and he is not, according to what he told me, a Wal-Mart employee.  He wouldn’t let me talk, and cut me off.  I will never ever deal with Wal-Mart Pharmacy again.  I will rather go and pay a little more elsewhere and deal with a professional pharmacy.  The name of pharmacist is Ashada.
*: I have been dealing with the Wal-Mart Pharmacy for almost 15 years now. It is becoming a pain and I am seriously thinking about changing. I request a refill. The pharmacy electronic sends a fax. Doctor’s office doesn't take electronic faxes. 
*: My husband picked up my medication. When he returned home I opened the stapled bag containing the medications only to have them spill everywhere. Imagine opening a bag of over pressurized chips only 1/16th the size. Why did this happen? Because the lid was not put on correctly. If the childproof lids are too much for the staff they shouldn't use them. Now will the pharmacy claim responsibility? No, absolutely not. They will, however, blame my husband, who opened the pills (didn't take any, just opened), then pulled a stapler out of thin air and made sure to staple exactly where the staff originally stapled it shut. That makes more sense to the pharmacist that was working at the time. Then one of her co-workers not capping it correctly. 
*: I take several medicines and have bought all of them at Walmart for at least 20 years.  I have had a prescription plan that paid some of my medicines and now, I'm on Medicare and have an RX supplement.  This particular problem I'm discussing here has happened more than once in the last couple of years but I've usually been able to get it straightened out in the store right then as soon as I noticed the error.  That was not the case this last time.
*: Just to let everyone know: if you complain about Wal-Mart Pharmacy or anything that happens in a situation with the Wal-Mart name and you think you are filing a complaint with home office, it actually goes to a call center and from there an e-mail is sent out and goes to the manager of that department or the manager you complained on. Unless it's extremely a serious complaint where they feel a lawsuit may happen, your complaint is not going to go anywhere. 
*: I have bought ** Insulins over the past 3 months.  Due to my present prescription plan capping, I had to buy the cheapest insulins with out of pocket money.  The insulins were in Lilly Boxes but were produced by Reli On.  All the insulins were totally inferior and did work a little bit.  But as an insulin user of 44 years, I suspected "foul play" with these vials as I immediately got extremely ill from both of the insulins.  And I had to take astronomical amounts to try and bring my blood sugar down.  I sent my husband out to buy ** from another pharmacy and they worked perfectly and I felt great afterwards! 
*: This is a very serious incident and not the first time it has occurred. I just opened my bag after picking up ** with a $45 copay. The bottle seal was ripped open and there were 20 pills in the bottle instead of 30. Last time this happened was several years ago and I started counting the pills at the counter, which I have since stopped doing. When I brought it up last time, I was told that it was impossible that they made this kind of error. I am hoping they have cameras on their employees because there is absolutely no doubt that someone stole 1/3 of my prescription. I will be complaining in person tomorrow.
*: On 01/08/2012 at 5:45 pm, my husband, son and I went to Wal-Mart pharmacy. The pharmacy tech did not greet us; my husband was told his prescriptions had expired. He then asked could he have a couple of pills to hold him while doctor give authorization to refill his blood pressure meds. The tech asked the pharmacist whose name we were told was "Missy". "Missy" did not move from behind her computer to come and speak discreetly to my husband. She proceeded to yell his personal information from behind the glass screen and refused to give him eye contact and rudely said she would not give him a couple blood pressure pills, rolled her eyes and there was a line of customers who heard all of it. 
*: 0 stars, in fact -100 stars for Wal-Mart pharmacy. I get my birth control filled at Wal-Mart as they offer a $9 prescription that is less than my insurance copy. However, my experience in filling that prescription is always terrible. This time took the cake though. 
*: I called in a prescription #7186692. This morning at 10:30 am, I just called to check on the prescription. And the lady on the phone said they had a problem with the prescription. I called the pharmacy at Hartwell, GA, where I go all the time. They put me on hold, for 4 minutes then hang up. This is the 3rd time that this happened in two months.
*: Wal-Mart Pharmacy will not refund my money for an unopened prescription. The pharmacist was very rude with me. I cannot find any policy that states that they do not accept unopened returns. After filling the prescription, I read the insert that comes with the package and it states that the medication is 'not safe for children under 5.' My daughter is only 2 and therefore I want to return the prescription. The Wal-Mart is located in Milledgeville, GA.
*: I went to pickup prescription for Low-T medicine, which is the ** 5 mg patch. It has worked wonders for me and Walmart now tells me that only the 4 mg is available and the 5 mg is discontinued. This is a 20% reduction in dosage they arbitrarily decided upon. They are not doctors! They do not control the dosage. Would it be correct to take a heart medicine at 10 mg and they decide they are only going to give a pill for 8 mg now without checking with the doctor? The consequence: decreased health benefit due to corporate profit line.
*: I am asking for replacement of my mother's ** 1000 mg. because of foul odor. First time pharm tech over the phone told me they are aware of the bad smell, told me to call supplier Heritage Pharmaceutical. I did and was told to go back Walmart to ask for replacement or refund. I did but was rudely shoved off by pharm tech Kayle and Emett. I talked with pharmacy manager and was told nicely to get prescription changed from 1000mg to 500mg (old stock and no bad odor). Those pharm tech Kayle and Emmett are not supposed to be dealing with customers. They are rude and not helpful at all. I wish for Walmart complaints dept to resolve this issue and reprimand these two pharm tech at Walmart located at 1501 east bucking ham rd. Richardson tx 75081.
*: I tried to fill my mom's prescription. she gets them by mail, but she did not have enough to get them in time. I have gotten them at this Wal-Mart before.  They claimed that the mail insurance was closed on a Saturday.  I know it was not.  I call on Saturdays. They refused to fill her prescription, and destroyed the bottles, so I could not get the prescription number and call it in.  They were rude. This is not the first time.  They are always too busy playing around, talking, and gossiping. This is the Wal-Mart at Clinton, Utah.
*: My physician increased my blood pressure medication by email and Wal-Mart gave me the old prescription. After several weeks of taking the prescription I continued to have head aches and high blood pressure. After I discovered the error my physician gave me a 30-day regimen of an added pill to decrease my blood pressure quickly. It is unclear at this point if I will have any lasting health issues due to this error, but I am compelled to bring this to your attention as it seem that you may have competency issues at this pharmacy or at least there needs to be more diligence in checking the prescriptions for accuracy. I would not be writing this if the pharmacy would have acted concerned, they just said it happens.
*: I was told they got prescription deliveries every 3 days. After 14 days, there are still no meds. With apologies no longer holding water, they finally called another pharmacy to get it filled. I hope you can imagine what it's like to go without meds for that long that has been taken for several years! My mental health suffered.
*: I do not understand why I am required to give my driver's license to CVS stores to purchase a money order? What is it needed for? Why do they need my driver's license number to take cash from me so I can pay my bills? Are they selling my information? Are they using my information to track who I pay and how much I am paying? I don't understand why after buying money orders from this organization for the past 20 years, is it so important for them to track my business in order to do business with them? Nowhere that I have been in the United States have I ever been asked for personal information in order to purchase a money order. When I asked the store managers at the stores in the Blair Plaza in Silver Spring and in the Aspen Hill Plaza, I was told that this is Corporate policy and if I did not supply them with this information, they could not sell me a money order?
*: I received a call back from the Brandt/Wal-Mart Pharmacy manager.  He is making good on the error of receiving the wrong insulin last week, and is giving me a gift card for $25, to buy the correct ** insulin! Kudos to Brandt! Thank you!
*: I went in yesterday, 12/14/11, to Wal-Mart Pharmacy store at #2515, 3721 E Thomas Rd., Phoenix, AZ 85018.  I asked for ** Insulin.  I was given a different looking Insulin ** 70/30.  I told the tech that it did not look the same as the one I had from Walgreens but thought it had to do with different packaging.  When I asked if the ** is the same, he said they are the same.  When I got home, I realized they are not the same.  When I called Wal-Mart Pharmacy, they said they are not permitted to allow exchanges or returns on insulin and they could not give me a credit either.  I spent nearly $25 and they more or less told me too bad!  Yet, their tech told me they were the same!
*: I got ** 10 mg tab (30-day supply filled). I was charged $14.84. Usually it cost $4. I asked the pharmacy department and they said that is just their price because it is. This was the Wal-Mart on Goldie Road, Youngstown, Ohio 44505. I telephoned the Wal-Mart in Boardman, Ohio; they said their ** 10 mg tab (30-day supply) is $4. Why such a huge price difference. I was told all Wal-Mart’s charge the same prices and honor the same prescription policies. I believe I was overcharged. I have several medications that I get filled there on Goldie Road. I do not have any insurance. I need to know what prices this Wal-Mart on Goldie Road charges. How can I obtain their price list since it is different than other Wal-Mart/Sam Club stores. This is also false advertisement on your TV commercial/internet. If I was over charged I would like my money refunded? Please respond.
*: WalMart and all pharmacies are amazing. I am just another in a hurry American, fat lazy idiot who doesn’t take care of myself and has diabetes, high cholesterol and an addiction to pain pills out of boredom. I can’t wait 10 minutes for medicines that can save my life. I'm probably on welfare for disability and waive what little copay I have. I am far too lazy to get my own scripts. I demand the pharmacist who is checking interactions call for me. I run out of refills and demand pills because I’m a consumer and they owe me everything. I can’t call them to see if it’s done. 
*: I have a question instead of a complaint.  Lately when I go to get my Rx (.25mg, 3 times per day) refilled at Wal-Mart, I've only been able to get a weekly supply of this medication, instead of a 30 day (90 pills) supply.  Have the laws and regulations for dispensing this medication become stricter?  Other than the pharmacy not having enough or not having any at all of the .25mg tablets, are there any other reasons why Wal-Mart’s pharmacy would dispense this medication to me in weekly amounts?  I'm just curious because it seems like this is the standard protocol lately.
*: I was prescribed a 25 mcg dosage of ** (hypothyroid medicine) by my doctor. The nurse called in the prescription and I went to Walmart to pick it up. I received a 125 mcg dosage instead. It’s very dangerous and I'm so lucky I noticed! The mistake would easily have gone unnoticed had I not done a bunch of online research before taking this drug since this was the first time I've ever gotten the drug! To boot, neither the doctor nor pharmacy will admit they screwed up and whose fault is it when they can't talk right to each other? It turned out to be a miscommunication between my doctor's office and the pharmacy. By luck in researching the drug's side effects, I caught the mistake!
*: I called in my prescription and was told it would be ready after 1:00 PM. I made the 18 mile (one way) trip and was told it was out of stock. I asked why I was not called before I drove all that way and was told on week-ends there are fewer employees and no one had the time. Really? There were 4 employees there at that time. Gas is not cheap, and I am tired of this happening, because it happened several times before, not only to me, but to my husband as well. Even when you call to check if it's ready, the computer states that it is, and you arrive, and it's not. Common customer service - pick up the phone and let the customer know it's out of stock. It's happened for the last time, my husband and I are taking all of our prescriptions elsewhere.
*: After waiting for one week to have my meds transferred from the Wal-Mart in Addison to the Wal-Mart in Elk Grove and 4 phones calls, last one to the manager Bonnie, I went to pick them up this evening. It came with with 4 scripts and 2 wrong. One was terribly incorrect in the store. After being there for one hour, it was taken cared of. The charge was also incorrect. Now, I am sitting here with another error. I take ** 50mg and they gave me 100 mg. What is wrong with these people? Here are the symptoms of too much of this med: heart palpitations, nervousness, trouble sleeping (insomnia), shaking (tremors), frequent bowel movements and too much weight loss.
*: I rushed out the door one day. I forgot to take BP meds. After a 3-hour drive, I felt bad. I went into Wal-Mart and took my BP. It was 168/132: not good. So I asked the girl at the pharmacy to transfer one each of the BP meds totaling 3.She said it would be an hour or so. I asked if it could be any sooner considering the issue, she said no. I then asked to speak with "Bob" the pharmacist at Concord, NH Walmart. Bob had heard this as well and ignored me. He never said a word. I went to sit down and when I sat and turned around, Bob had a ** grin on his face. I wanted to choke the sob.
*: Can't fill but part of a prescription have to make more than one trip to get a prescription filled. I am a diabetic who needs testing supplies and 99% of the time they are unable to fill the entire prescription. It makes me angry because it costs more money and my time to obtain what I need to regulate my glucose.I don't know what good it really does to complain. They don't listen. Thank you.
*: It was bad when I went in. There were more than ten people standing in line waiting at the pharmacy. There are six people at the back filling orders or walking around. Why can't one or more come out and help the two girls catch up? We, the ones in line, were talking about the bad service at the pharmacy on Beltline Blvd. in Florence SC and we may move to a different pharmacy.
*: Every month I have the same medication filled and every month there is a problem. Well, I have had it. This month of November, I called the prescription in and they said it would be 30 minutes and it would be done. I got there about 5 hours later and she said, “Oh, there was a problem with the insurance company.” I said it couldn't be. It is exactly 30 days since I had it refilled and she got really snotty with me and her faced turned red, and I knew she was mad. She called the insurance company, and all of a sudden, nope, there was no problem. She said, “Oh, it must have gotten mixed up with another person’s.” I was so mad but, said nothing. So then I waited 30 more minutes to get them to refill it. 
*: I have had other prescriptions filled here, but I'm done.  Each time, they are either busy, and there is a wait, or they are not busy and there is still a wait. The last two times, I came in to pick up my refill, there were several employees behind the counter, yet I stood waiting for someone to even acknowledge me before finally walking over to assist me (A simple "Hi, we'll be right with you" goes a long way). Today, I had called in a prescription refill, and I had also brought one to have filled. There were no other customers, and several (about 7 or 8) employees behind the counter standing in a group. 
*: We subscribe to Tricare for Life and have been able to get the $4 generic prescription medications for $3 as a result.  Last month Tricare raised its copay amount to $5.  So now, Wal-Mart charges us $5 for the $4 scripts.
*: I have never really used WalMart Pharmacy (3501 Route 42 - Turnersville, NJ 08012) before and I will be absolutely desperate before I use them again. Everyone here from the pharmacist to the pharm. technician was completely incompetent. Even though they claim to care about privacy, there is no such thing as my personal business was shouted across the pharmacy by the technician with a long line of people waiting and listening! The whole ordeal was ridiculous. First I had to stand and wait for 45 minutes while the technician (Tess) tried to figure out how the computer works instead of just asking for help. She finally did ask someone and whatever she was looking for was completed in 3 seconds after she just stared at the screen for the 1st 45 minutes. She never apologized for making me wait and then she told me to wait another 30 minutes for my RX to get prepared. 
*: I had an antibiotic prescription for a one-year old that has a severe case of strep throat. When I turn in the prescription, the guy at the pharmacy counter tells me there is a two hour wait. I ask if there is any way this can be rushed because it is for an infant and he tells me no and proceeds to hand me back my prescription when I ask why he says it will be a two-hour wait. So I tell him that doesn't make up for the fact I need the prescription. I wait two hours and return to the pharmacy to be told it still isn't done. I have sat here another hour and a half and still have not received. If this wasn't for my one-year old, I would have walked out! This is ridiculous! N Garland Walmart pharmacy has lost a loyal customer! I will take my business to Target!!!
*: On November 11, 2011, I picked up a prescription for ** HFA, an inhaler for asthma. I followed directions but the inhaler sprayed a mist only one time. On November 12, I returned the inhaler to the store and told the pharmacist that the inhaler did not work. He sprayed it and it worked one time and he told me that I need to use more strength. 
*: I need to pick up an Rx that was ordered for me about 21/2 hours earlier. It was a ** pack. All they had to do was put it in the computer and stick a label on it. I was in a great deal of pain from an inflammation of the sciatic nerve. While waiting in line, the person ahead of me seemed to be friends or a relative of the pharm tech. She was ringing up an entire order twice because she did it wrong the first time, of over $73. 
*: I take ** because my body no longer makes cortisol. My endocrinologists says that I have to have this medication to live. I have the prescription on automatic refill, so WalMart knows that I will need the prescription every month without fail. Yet every time it needs refilling, they are out of stock. If they have any inventory control system at all they would have the medication in stock. This last time I received 4 emails saying the prescription was ready. When we drove 20 miles one way to pick up the prescription we were informed it was out of stock and would be in the next day. The next day we were given 6 pills and told the rest would be available the next day. This will be our third trip to pick up this necessary medication. This is not the first time this has happened. Every time this prescription has been refilled except one, they have been out of stock. Once they gave me 10 mg instead of 5 mg which I had to cut into halves and quarters to get my correct dosage.
*: I was assured on refill for my Rx for cervical dystonia (**) was a different color, but the same medication. After taking it, and not figuring out why I was not feeling well, for over a week... I woke one night in screaming pain in my neck/back/arm. Only it hurt too bad to scream. I then called to have Rx refilled with the green ones and the Teva brand I had normally gotten.
*: Recently, I have had a very bad experience at Wal-Mart pharmacy located in Grapevine.  I took my prescription for ** 200 mg (generic version) to the pharmacy on 11/08/11.  I was advised by the pharmacy technician that they do not have the medication in stock, but they can get it for me by tomorrow (11/9/11) after 2:00 p.m.  On the 9th, my father and I went to the pharmacy to pick-up my medication which is very crucial for me.  The pharmacy asked us reluctantly to come back next day just because someone forgot to order it for us.  After explaining the importance of this medication to the pharmacist, she gave me 3 capsules (free of charge) and promised to get this medication ready for me on the 10th.  
*: Just about every time I fill a prescription at Wal-Mart, it takes them several hours to get it if it has been called in.  You can call and they will claim they have checked the fax, e-mail, and voicemail.  And they will say it is not there.  Call the doctor back and they will say they called a few hours ago.  Call Wal-Mart back and they don’t have it.  It goes on and on.  Wait until the next day and check.  Mysteriously it has been filled.  My doctor must have called it in at 9 pm right?  CVS and Wal-Mart practice this delightful customer service just about every time a prescription is called in for me.  
*: I have been a customer at Wal-Mart in Rapid City SD since it opened. I have noticed a significant decline in customer service. I am specifically upset because I went to the pharmacy which had posted open hours for Sunday 10 am- 6 pm.
*: Had 3 prescriptions filled at Walmart. I took my first dose of all my med's at 4:30 & knew I would have to take the ** again by 8:30- which I took. I still had too take the last two medications, but not until 12:30am, so I poured the meds in my hand to grab one out & sit it on the night stand till it was 12:30--this is when I discovered my medication was short 6 pills. There were only 13 pills in my hand (I took one at 4:30pm & was preparing to take one at 12:30). 
*: The wait time to have a prescription filled even after it's called in is getting ridiculous.  The lines are long and many people in line are talking about going elsewhere.  Why advertise about good prices when I have to spend 30-45 minutes in line?  The pharmacists are doing the best they can, but there doesn't seem to be as many of them.  Who at the corporate office decided that our time isn't worth anything?
*: We picked up my prescriptions at the Wal-Mart Pharmacy and paid for it at the pharmacy counter like always. In fact, my husband remembers the clerk asking if we would like to ring up all of our purchases at the register, but he declined explaining we had other shopping, and then proceeded to pay for the prescriptions. Wal-Mart does not allow you to pay for prescriptions anywhere except at their own counter (At least none of the Wal-Mart's here in Colorado Springs do.) However, over two weeks later we received a "bill" from the Wal-Mart Asset Protection Recovery dept in St. Louis, MO saying we did not pay for the prescriptions and must send them a check. 
*: My husband called in a prescription on Sunday. Then he realized Monday morning, he needed another one filled. He called it in before I went to work, which was around 8 am. He asked me if I would pick it up on my lunch break. No problem. So I stood in line, only one is ready. How long would it be before the other one is ready? Only five or ten minutes, so I browse around the store for fifteen minutes and then go stand in line and wait my turn, but still not filled. I say that's okay I will come back after work and pick it up. 
*: You people are ridiculous. You complain your medicines aren't covered by the insurance and want us to wave a magic wand over the paperwork and somehow pops up your regular copay. You complain about 15-minute wait time. You complain about your prescription being put back after nine days. Hey, I got an idea.  How about you pick up your fn prescription when you say you're going to! Or at least within a week!
*: I am very upset with this pharmacy and their employees. Every time I have a prescription called in or walked in and I try to get it, they say there is no prescription here or we can't fill it. This is also happening to my daughter-in-law. They are rude to us and many more. 
*: As a committed customer to Walmart and its pharmacy, on 16 Sept 11, I placed my prescription to treat shingles in Walmart in Salinas, CA for two medications.  They told me that I need to wait about an hour.  I asked them if I can pick it up from Marina because I live there.  They said that is fine.  So I went to Marina to pick up the medication and went home.
*: First, let me start off by saying this.  I know how the Rx operates very well.  In this day in age, it seems as though everyone complains about everything.  Walmart stores have recently been told to cut 100 staff hours weekly.  This is resulting in short staffing and stressed, overworked employees.  Also, Walmart is hiring techs in at the lowest possible wages P/T.  If an Rx staff member seems upset or has an attitude, I can almost guarantee it's not towards any customer, but towards the company they work for.  Thank them sometimes and it will help them brighten their day.  
*: I dropped off a prescription at approximately 3:30pm. After it took about 30 min for the girl behind the counter to type in all of my information, including insurance info, I was told it would take one hour. At 4:45pm, I came back, waited 15 minutes in line, and when I finally got to the counter, I was told that the Rx was not ready and to come back in about an hour. At 6:20pm, I came back again, waited 30 minutes in line this time, and then when I was finally at the counter, the Rx was ready. But unfortunately, the idiot had not ran it under my insurance. 
*: We went to get medicine filled. The girl was rude from the get go, did not want to take our card and said it wouldn't save anything but it did. We shopped and came back to get it. We just stood there, no one else in line, while she just walked around. She didn't want to answer any questions and said just wait a minute; started to staple papers we asked her not to and she did anyway and walked over to where the pharmacist would give it to us. Finally, she walked over and rudely asked if we had questions. I said, no. She started to staple and we said no. She threw it down on the counter at us. I told her they need to change their attitude.
*: I had been using the neighborhood Walmart Pharmacy in Bedford, Texas.  I finally decided I have had enough of their bad mannered employees, not to mention the truly bad pharmacy service.  So for me, the answer was to go elsewhere, and there's a Walgreens across the street!  I printed a list of my medicines.  Walgreens is so  much better with a nice staff.  So, thanks Walgreens, and goodbye forever to Walmart RX.
*: I had the most disrespectful experience when I went to have my prescription filled; Amanda ** was rude and insolent. I explained that I never shopped at the other Wal-Mart and that I had picked up my prescriptions at that very Wal-Mart in my neighborhood. At this point Amanda turned her screen around to tell me the prescription was called in at the Wal-Mart across town. I told her I didn't need to read her computer screen, I just needed my prescription. After asking five times to have the prescription filled, she wanted to have a staring competition as though I needed to beg her for service.
*: I had a refill on my ** and I called the Oakland, Tennessee Walmart to get it refilled.  It had been exactly 30 days and that is when my doctor told me I could get the refill.  The pharmacist told me that she would not fill the script until two days later, which made no sense whatsoever.  I then went to Kroger and showed them the bottle.  They said no problem and that they would call Oakland, Tennessee Walmart to get a transfer and they would fill it right away.  They called Walmart and the witch refused to transfer the medication.  They couldn't believe it, they said that they have never had that happen before.  
*: I called the pharmacy on 86th St. in Indianapolis, Indiana to see if they had ** available.  The pharmacy manager, Ms. **, wouldn't tell me if they had it in stock.  She told me that it's store policy that she couldn't tell me over the phone.  I called two other Walmart pharmacies, one in Fishers, IN and Nobleviles, IN and both pharmacies told me that they were out of stock.  My question is, why aren't the policies the same?  All Ms.** had to say was whether they had it in stock or not.  I don't want to waste the time and gas to get there only to find out that they didn't have the medicine in stock.  I was put on hold two different times for 10 minutes each to talk to a store manager about this problem.  I think the pharmacy thought that I was going to let go of this issue so they put me on hold for such a long time.
*: I pick up a prescription for 60 ** and only 45 pills were in the bottle. Walmart shorted me 15 pills! I cannot believe that was an accident or a mistake.
*: I went to the pharmacy, and after 2 days, my refills were still not ready. I called the doctor's office, and they said that they did not have a request, but would call it in immediately, which they did. Though I was the only one waiting, the "mouthy" pharmacist put my order at the end of the line of the refills she had lined up and said it would be at least 30 minutes until she could do it. She said she was the only one taking calls and she was doing all she could. I had to ask for their phone number and street address for my doctor's office, which she "didn't have time for".
*: I have experienced the final straw in the lack of professionalism, customer service, and customer concern for the Walmart Pharmacy located at 6900 US 19 North, Pinellas Park, FL 33781. They do nothing to accommodate your pharmaceutical requirements other than filing what they 'have on hand'.' If they are out of a medication, you do not know that until you try to retrieve the order from the store. They do not try to find' the medication at another Walmart store as it will take them all day but are happy for you to call the various Walmarts to see if you can track down the medication.
*: This is not the first time I've had to wait this long.  The rude woman at the register told me that the medicine just came in, so it hasn't even been put in the computer yet.  I watched the doctor send it on his computer and then waited about an hour and a half before I got it.  There's another girl here who they also told the same thing.
*: I was a customer of the Walmart pharmacy. I requested a refill for one of my regular medications on September 1st. I went to pick it up on September 4th (because I am carless) and was informed that Medicaid would not pay for it because the prescription was already filled this month at "another pharmacy".
*: On 08/25/2011, I had a prescription filled for ** at the San Marcos, Texas store.  They substituted the generic without even asking me.  When I questioned it, they informed me that it's up to me to insist on brand.  I expressed that I do not agree, they should ask!  I had another prescription for ** filled on 09/08/2011 at the New Braunfels, Texas store.  At drop off, I clearly stated that I did not want generic.  The girl at drop off window repeated to confirm.  However, they filled it generic again anyway.  I did not notice until 09/09/2011.  
*: I have been getting one of my medicines from here because of the price.  When my doctor called them in, they started telling me that my insurance will not pay, and I will have to wait.  So, I waited.  Then, they said they had called them and that I had gotten some medicines somewhere else.  They said that I would have to wait more. So, I did.  And I got the same story over and over.  I called my old pharmacy.  They told me that I should call the insurance myself and I did.  They told me they had not talked to anyone.  I talked to my doctor.  And I confirmed that they had not talked to my doctor either.  Then, when I called the pharmacy, they started talking to me about how high of a dosage I was on, as if that was their business.  I do not like being treated like a pill head!  I will never go there again.
*: "Someone" in the pharmacy switched my birth control prescription without the permission of my doctor. When I called to ask why they were switched on 8/3/11, I was told that the manufacturing company stopped making the prescription which was a lie. I didn't find out until this month when I went in to complain about the side affects the pills were having on me physically/emotionally. Then I was told that the manufacturing company hadn't stopped making them but they still wouldn't fix my prescription until they talk with my doctor. The staff at Wal-Mart's pharmacy never did call me. I had to call them several times to finally get the answer I knew all along. My doctor had not allowed such a change! I got no apologies or anything of such!
*: The pharmacist, first name Mark, took it upon himself to call the prescribing doctor of one of my narcotic medications. He provided the ER doctor, Windham Community Memorial Hospital, Max **, MD, with false/insufficient information regarding a past script for **.
*: No problem, this is just a comment. Since people seem to be getting shorted on pills, it would be wise to count the number of pills in the bottle before leaving the store; preferably, while still at the counter. Any shortage can then be reported and corrected immediately.
*: We had a prescription called into Walmart Pharmacy in Rhinelander, WI about 30 minutes before we stopped by the counter to pick it up. They already had the information and told us they were working on it and it would be ready in about 30 minutes. So we said we would shop until then and be back. Exactly 30 minutes later, we stopped back and they told us it would be ready in about 5 minutes, they were "working on it". We sat on the seats provided for another 24 minutes, went back up to the counter and spoke to the pharmacist. She told us they were working on it. I looked at her and said, "You know what, just keep it". We were on our way home 15 minutes later and received a recorded message from the pharmacy telling us that our prescription was ready to be picked up. If this is Walmart's policy to try to keep people in the store longer to keep them shopping and spending money, that is so wrong. This prescription was for our dog, just so you know. I have never been a fan of Walmart and this just assures me I am right. They are crook.
*: This is Dr. Farzad ** living in **. I have a complaint about a pharmacy Store in Isabela. 
*: On my first visit on July 6, 2011, the wrong medication was filled that the doctor prescribed. Second, when the medication was correctly filled, it was 10 times the strength that the doctor prescribed.
*: My migraine medication was no longer available.  I saw my doctor for a new prescription.  She suggested ** and sent the prescription to the pharmacy of my choice. My prescription was filled on the 2nd of August and I picked it up on the 5th. The cost was 28, so I asked if it had gone through my insurance because my previous medication didn't cost that much. I was told that indeed it had. I signed and paid for my prescription. 
*: We are from Southern California and my son goes to college at University of Montana Tech. My son was there for the summer football camp. Our Dr. called in a prescription to the Walmart Pharmacy in Butte, MT at the end of July for an inhaler for our son because he has allergies, sinus trouble and was having trouble breathing. This is our son's second year there, so our doctor has called in his prescriptions there many times and he has frequented that Walmart Pharmacy many times to pick up his prescriptions. After our Dr. called in his prescription for inhaler in July, he called us to tell us it was ready. My son (not having a car) took a cab over to the Walmart, only to be told that they had no prescription for him and have no record of him in their system! I called there immediately and they gave me the same run around. 
*: On 8/21/2011, I had a prescription transferred from Walmart Pharmacy in Shallotte, NC. When I went and got it, I took it at home but found out that it was the wrong thing. I did not open the box and took it back. I had spelled out the name of the medicine and gave my RX number, I told them it was for my ear. Crystle ** did not want to change it. She said that it was not for my ear but what she gave me was. I told her I didn't care what it was for she gave me the wrong prescription and I was not going to use it. I said I want what the doctor prescribed for me. 
*: Late July, ordered a cream and **. 8/4 I talk to them and they say the cream isn't in stock. Said 8/15 it will be in. I said that's fine. I asked if they had my CC number to fulfill the order, they said yes. They didn't send the **, they just sat on it waiting for the cream. Mid August rolls around, they're trying to reach me again. They need permission to use my card for my meds. I grant permission AGAIN. Their database makes it to where they have to mark it in the notes section which many reps miss. 2 reps missed this hence the need for follow up to me. They say they're going to finally ship out now. This was 8/16.
*: I have three prescriptions at your pharmacy that the Pain Clinic calls in each month. Yesterday, I went to pick up one. I was told that it was not ready and that the brand name for this script would be $165. I had been getting the brand name through a patient prescription program and I was informed by the pharmacy a couple of months ago, that the insurance is no longer available. 
*: I went to pick up my Rx that had been called in, but they only had a partial earlier.  I was told that my Rx had been put back that morning (I was there about 9:20 am, and they open at 9:00am), because I only have 8 days to pick it up.  I was then told I had to re-order the Rx at the drop off window.  That lady was super nice and did everything she could to speed up the fill.  Soon I received a text that it was ready, and none of the cashiers could find my Rx.  The pharmacist said she was finishing it, and the cashier could see my frustration for having to wait.  I simply noted that I was annoyed that I had to wait on an Rx that had already been filled, but had been put back.  
*: My dentist phoned in order for pain medicines and oral rinse.  When I got there, the order wasn't ready and they said she hadn't phoned it in.  
*: My dentist phoned in order for pain medicines and oral rinse.  When I got there, the order wasn't ready and they said she hadn't phoned it in.  
*: I pulled a muscle while at work and Walmart was the closest, and the only open place, to get my meds filled. The service was fine other than the long wait but when I got home and went to put my meds up, I noticed that I was missing 18 of my pain pills.
*: I picked up prescriptions today.  Something told me to count the pills in the bottles.  Two scripts were short some pills.
*: I went to pick up my prescription ** for my diabetes. When I got back to the car, open it, realized that only gave 15 pills. Took it back in and the pharmacy said it would be a minute and they would get the right amount. After waiting 10 minutes, the lady told me it was ready and ask me my birthday, gave me my medicine. After about 10 days of taking the medicine I began to get really sick and my sugar count kept going up. So on the 23rd of July I pull all my medicine and realized at that time they have given me ** < 50MG meds. So I called Decatur Pharmacy, told them they had given me the wrong meds and when I went to pick them up they offered me a 25 dollar gift card for their mistake. On July 29 I went to my family doctor with my sugar at 375 and a bad kidney infection and blood pressure 172/100. What will be my options to pursue and major suit against Decatur Walmart. 
*: I dropped off a prescription and was told it would take 30 - 45 minutes. There was no other customer in the pharmacy, but we walked around the store and did our shopping. We came back in 30 minutes and was told that it was going to take awhile because they were busy. I asked if they could text me when the prescription was ready. They agreed, verified my cellphone number, and I sat down in the pharmacy to wait. My son and husband were with me. My son was just discharged from the hospital and was tired.
*: I know my complaint is one of MANY complaints and it looks like, from experience and reading of these complaints, that nothing will be done, until a boycott of Walmart pharmacies occur.  I am a nurse in a doctor's office and I have witnessed so many mistakes and patient complaints about Walmart pharmacies---too numerous to mention.
*: In December of 2010 I had prescriptions filled at the Wal-Mart Pharmacy in Naples Florida (Airport Pulling Rd) and I took those prescriptions with me on a trip for the holidays in NY. I was taking what the bottle said was ** and I wasn't really feeling well. When I got back to Florida I brought the bottle into the Pharmacy and asked if the pills were really **. The Pharmacy said no they were not but a hormone I was taking. I have called Wal-Mart Customer service two times and have NOT received a response.
*: Patient called because pharmacy would not refill **. Staff member spoke with pharmacist who informed her that med could not be called in with 12 refills, only 6. Staff member informed pharmacist that she was not aware of that. Pharmacist stated "stupid people do stupid things sometimes. How do you think your Dr would look in orange." Staff member was very insulted by this and I find it very unprofessional.
*: Tried to fill a prescription at the Wal-Mart in Savoy IL. They only had three days worth of the medicine. They wanted to know if we wanted to transfer to the Wal-Mart in Champaign IL.. We accepted. Drove 9 miles, waited TWO AND A HALF HOURS for the prescription to be filled only to find out they were also short of the full prescription. Left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing in this company. Wal-Mart in Savoy, IL should have asked if they had "enough" as in quantity of pills at the Champaign location instead of just asking if they had it. We were trying to use a coupon and were told at the doctor's office to wait until we had a full order otherwise we would not be able to get the full amount offered. 
*: This pharmacy technician/cashier, Megan, has the worst customer service and bad attitude I've ever seen. Two to three days ago, from when I dropped-off the prescription until I picked up the medicine, this girl had bad attitude with me. I've been to other pharmacies. Usually, people greet you with something like this, "Hello, how can I help you today?", and with a smiling face. This ** of a person, Megan, greets me with, "Yes?" And rolling her eyes and giving me a nasty attitude before I even opened my mouth to say anything. I was thinking to myself, "Oh, well, maybe she's having a bad day. "So, I dropped the prescription and was told by her that it was going to take three to four hours for pick-up. I said, "Wow. That long?" Since my daughter needed the medicine as soon as possible. She replied, "Yes. It takes that long," with a raised voice, and mumbling to herself some ** about me. I said, "What did you say?" She replied, "Nothing." So I left it alone and went about my way to come and pickup the medicine four hours later. 
*: My parents strictly use the Walmart pharmacy here in town and for some time now, I've been very disappointed in the customer service. We can call in a refill at 9am when the pharmacy opens, and go to pick it up at 6pm in the evening, and it still has to be waited on, because its not ready yet. There are two pharmacists, and neither of them, are what I would consider friendly at all.
*: Yesterday, my sister, who suffers from Multiple Sclerosis, visited the Pharmacy Department to have her medicine filled. She was told that she would have to wait an hour. That was not a problem. When the prescription was ready, they paged her. When she went up to the counter to pick up her medicine, the clerk loudly and in front of other customers told her she cut in line and had to wait just like everyone else. My sister was sick, out of medicine and by this time having trouble walking. This may seem like nothing to some people but my sister is an upbeat, sweet person who is considerate of others. This clerk embarrassed and humiliated her. If I lived there, this store would be getting to talk to me personally. They made my sister sicker. That angers me. I had to fight tears when she was telling me what the clerk did to her. So if anyone from the Wal-Mart corporate offices would like to explain to me how this follows their customer service and human relations principles, they may contact me personally. Then, they can apologize to my poor sister who is a loyal customer as well.
*: My 10 year old daughter was taken to the doctor's office with severe throat pain, swelling and fever of 101.2. She was diagnosed with severe strep shown in a culture that was putting my daughter in danger of getting her airway closed and can barely talk or eat and drink. She was given two prescriptions with specific instructions to start antibiotics and steroid immediately to prevent airway obstruction. I took prescription to Wal-Mart. The pharmacist stated that prescription will be ready today but it will take time due to them being backed up due to a blackout they had yesterday. 
*: When I got home and was dividing out my medicine for the month, I found out that I was 10 pills short! I have chronic back pain due to degenerative bone disease. It is imperative that I have this medicine.
*: I went to fill a prescription. They said it would take about 30 minutes. I told them that I would wait in the store. They said they would call me when it's ready. I waited about 45 minutes and never heard anything. I went back, and they said it was not ready because it said on my file that I was allergic to Morphine. Well, I had this medicine filled here before a long time ago.
*: This was my first time (and would be my last time) to have my prescription filled at this location. First, when I went to the drop-off section, there was this Asian male clerk standing at the computer. I gave him my prescription, instead of asking drug-related or any of that matter, he looked at me and asked me what my ethnicity was and why I changed my name. I thought it was very unprofessional due to code of ethics that he studied from his pharmacy school before graduating. He should know better not to ask such too personal questions. I don't know him as well as he doesn't know me. This would violate the HIPAA law for privacy purposes. 
*: My Doctor ordered 20 units of ** insulin daily. It comes in 10ml vials. I was charged for 50 doses. The problem is, the medication expires 28 days after opening the vial. There is no way to get 50 doses from one vial. Upon questioning Walmart, they insisted this is their policy. They even placed a black magic marker line, through the "discard by" date. The box plainly states to discard after 28 days. In addition to attempting to charge me for 22 dose of medication I could not use, they are in the practice of dispensing medication with these guidelines that can cause serious harm to someone unaware of the discard date.
*: Avoid Walmart and go to a local 24-hour pharmacy.
*: Diagnosed with H. Pylori and given first course of antibodies and did well but still have some muscle pain and some coughing. I contacted doctor to discuss a second course of antibody. Dad had stomach cancer. Doctor called in second course to Wal-Mart, which was filled. The patient picked up prescription. Patient looked at prescribed pills and all looked the same. Patient began to take pills. The first dosage completely knocked her out; the second left her with swelling and a dry mouth and blurry vision. Patient thought that the side affects were from the antibodies. Patient knew that the seriousness of the. Patient began to complain to several people that the medication had a different affect, not knowing she continued to take medication until told to stop by the hospital. Bacteria continued to take the medication.
*: This has got to be the sorriest company I've ever been. I know this complaint is no good because all u care about is your greedy pockets getting fatter.
*: On December 2, I took 2 prescriptions in; one to fill and the other to wait one month. I asked for how long and they replied 25 minutes. So I said mail it out. They said okay. On Monday, I called to check and was told pills were ready to mail. On December 9, I drove up there again and said I wanted to pick up the pills because they never arrived at my house. They said no, they are in the mail. On Thursday afternoon, I got a recording from the pharmacy saying my pills are up there and have not been picked up and that is when I got mad because I was just up there. End of story, I changed to Walmart in Litchfield and I can go get the pills today. Now that is over two weeks, one week without pills. How can they hold medication hostage? And I have a multi-level degenerative disc disease.
*: I called for an Rx refill on ** tab, which I have been getting there for the past 2 years under a discount rate of $10.00 for a 90 day supply. I renewed my Rx by phone on 12/9/2010, went in to pick it up and was told the rate had increased to around $55.00. I asked the tech why didn't anyone had the courtesy to call and let me know this drug was no longer available at the discounted rate. She answered, "prices go up overnight". They had 4 days to call me! I took the container to Walgreens, and purchased the same generic drug for $18.17! What's wrong with this picture! Walmart does not care about their customers! Needless to say, Walgreens has a new Rx customer! There was no damage, just plain irritation over your Rx policies.
*: We are elderly and have a problem with the RX blister packages. It is so easy to mix up the RX and also it is very difficult to burst the pills, many times they break upon bursting them out. My husband has gotten his RX mixed up and so has the pharmacy. I would rather pay a little more to get them in the old bottles. I am afraid my husband is going to take the wrong drugs or not enough of one due to breaking upon bursting.
*: This pharmacy routinely fails to complete my prescriptions after their robotic telephone system informs me that "your prescription has been refilled and is awaiting pick up". Often I will run completely out at which time they offer me three-six tablets (one to two day supply) until it can be refilled.  Today they informed me that they shorted my prescription because they had already given me six tablets. I said you shorted me 12 tablets so the math isn't accurate. Furthermore you had already provided those six tablets because you shorted me last month. Last month it took three trips to get the single prescription refilled. The pharmacist or technician said, "Yeah, well that looks like all we can give you".
*: I picked up a prescription Wednesday and my bottle of medicine only contained 23 of the 30 tablets. I understand that medicine is something that has to be heavily regulated and society today really abuses the system. Yet, I am not an addict, I am very ethical, I am honest, and I am a good and loving husband to a great wife of almost six years.
*: I've never had a problem with my local Walmart pharmacy. They've always worked with me and helped me when my doctor overbooks himself and it's hard to get an appointment with him.
*: I would choose Wal-Mart 10 times over. Their $4 program has saved me thousands over the years. Wal-Mart employee was the first to tell me about DrugRX to help me save when I lost my insurance.
*: It's just easy to use and often inexpensive. I always go to Walmart for something from food to clothes to oil changes, so why not get my medicine. But honestly I can't afford to go to the doctor.
*: Walmart does not have a drive thru pharmacy nor do they offer home delivery. Often times you stand in line 20 minutes or more to pick up a prescription as they only have one person at the desk.
*: Walmart pharmacist was very helpful & patient when I called to see if they had the drugs I needed & if they took the RX card-Since I had no insurance. She went out of her way to help me.
*: My Pharmacist is very cognizant of my needs, quick to warn me about interactions and special instructions. They fill my prescriptions very quickly and the prices are great.
*: They are fast, efficient, and friendly. Not only that, they have managed customer and employee safety during the virus outbreak exceptionally well!
*: The Pharmacist is great. Very professional and knowledgeable. Has a great personality and seems to care about his clients.
*: They open late. They put back medicine early. There will be a half dozen workers chatting while only one works. They don't care about customers at all. I wish my insurance worked elsewhere.
*: I have been getting my prescriptions from Walmart for over a year now and I have had great service from them. The only thing that happens is it does take a little longer than it should do to complete.
*: Walmart has been my pharmacy for years. The pharmacy staff are very efficient and caring also very informative on the medications. And they're also very reasonable.
*: I never have any problems or issues at Walmart. The pharmacist is available to answer questions. If there is any possible interactions with other medications they let you know.
*: I’ve used Walmart for far too long. Quite a few times they are out of my medication. I had to wait. Now I’m going to use CVS since my Ins. Co prefers CVS. I have to see my doctors to change scripts.
*: Since I do not have insurance I must watch every penny that goes out the door. Sam's prices are a lifesaver! I use them for everything including vaccinations. The staff is tops in the industry!
*: I was forced to switch pharmacies when I was put on Medicaid. I was very disheartened. The only pharmacy that carries my medication is Wal-Mart in my town. I had used them before and didn't like them. One pharmacist literally hit on my husband when he went to get my script twice! The medication is always old. It has No snap to it. ** and any pill when fresh or kept right should snap and be fresh. I would get my script and it would crumble when I went to snap it in half. I mean crumble into pieces! No snap. Also when I took it and take it now it has lost potency. I'm literally laying on the couch like I took nothing. Very annoying. The sad thing is I'm stuck with these old pills all month! I had this problem then years ago and have this problem now all over again.
*: I am quarantined in Nh but usually live in MA. The Walmart pharmacy would not mail me my prescription even though we are in a PANDEMIC and on lockdown. So, after pulling teeth, and a ton of reps who "didn't have any answers", I have it sent to a NH location, and then, the walmart in NH almost tripled the cost of the prescription. Walmart does not care that we are on lockdown and is making it impossible for me to get a much needed medication. My only option at this point is to pay 3x the amount for it. Greedy disgusting thing to do to people during a pandemic when they know most of us are out of jobs. WOW. GREAT JOB WALMART.
*: Hello all, I am posting a different kind of review about my pharmacy here.... I use Walmart Pharmacy for my prescriptions, and have asked them repeatedly to stop having an automated robo call sent to me every time I request a refill, but they will not do so. Despite the fact that every single time I contact the pharmacy, and ask to be removed from this feature.
*: I go out of my way to go to this Wal-Mart but the action of the pharmacy today has left me outdone! At 4:48, I received a message that the COUGH medicine I have been waiting for since Thursday, because given that COVID-19 is primarily a COUGH, Wal-Mart, a pharmacy that I go to because I can get medicine there for less than 1/4 what it costs, with insurance, at the nearest pharmacy, let the COUGH MEDICINE supply run out, knowing, because they told me so when I called, that there would not be another delivery for 5 days. 
*: I called Wal-Mart Pharmacy customer service this morning to find out about your prescription medicine delivery service because I am disabled and my family is in the high risk category for COVID-19. I got the rep on the phone and asked her about this and she said I had to call my insurance company and then my doctor so they can set up an account, which is fine, but the script has already filled, and is waiting at the store. I just needed it delivered. So I asked her what I could do to get it today.
*: Through with Walmart Pharmacy. Lately my medications are on backorder more and more frequently. Even common medications such as blood pressure medicine. Now I have developed shingles in my right eye. Eye Dr called in a prescription eye gel. Now, this is serious, I could suffer permanent damage to my eye if not treated soon enough. It's now been 5 days since my prescription order was placed. They say it is on backorder. I was lucky enough that the Dr. had a couple of samples, but she gave me the last two and I only have enough for today's dosage. I don't believe this "backorder" excuse. It's walmart, they are not willing to employ enough people to get the job done. That being said I intend to call them today and tell them to just transfer that $474 medication to CVS.
*: I dropped off 3 prescription on Tuesday 01/21/20, two were filled, one did have a diagnosis code. The third one they said had no diagnosis code. So I called the doctor office. The pharmacy said they faxed the doctor office. So Wednesday I called the doctor office left message. Thursday I called the doctor office left message. Friday I called the doctor office. Explained the issue. So I finally got through. They called the pharmacy with the diagnosis code. Now I go online to check status. Medication not in stock. We will contact you in 1 to 2 days, that was Friday. Today is Sunday 01/26/20. Now wouldn't you think they would order the medication prior to Friday.
*: After my first visit to a Pain Clinic, I took a prescription to Walmart for a narcotic. I’ve taken narcotics before after surgeries and I’ve never had problems before. When I’m not in pain, I just don’t take pain medicine. Walmart’s pharmacy staff made me feel like a junkie with all the questions about what it was for and why I went to that particular pain clinic! They initially sent the prescription back to me by my husband after I was told on the phone, by the pharmacist, that he would fill it and after he or somebody wrote back pain on my actual prescription.
*: Took my script in to be filled, the woman tech said she could fill my script, all the while looking at her computer. She told me to come back in an hour. When I went back in two hours she handed me my script and said she could not fill it. This woman is playing God as there were enough meds to fill my script. She is rude and talks down to people. Many complaints have been lodged against her to the now departed Pharmacist who was demoted and relocated.
*: I am so unhappy about the service and attitudes of the staff and pharmacists at this store. Last month I took a prescription in for a cough medicine that they said was a narcotic and the pharmacist "chose" to not fill it. She said that the other pharmacists would, but she personally chose to not fill narcotics for this doctor (from a reputable, local doctor). Who is she to decide who to fill prescriptions for? I took in a prescription yesterday for something I have been on for 10 year, but the dosage had changed. It was a printed prescription on the doctor's form. They acted like I was a criminal and wouldn't fill it without verifying with the doctor that it was legitimate.
*: My insurance last year eliminated the over 20 year satisfied use of my previous pharmacy leaving me with limited options. Walmart Pharmacy in Brockport NY is what I was left with in my town and it has been an insufferable nightmare since with a few exceptions that allowed me to give it an additional star. It is so bad. Just thinking of going there gives me such extreme anxiety and they rarely fail to deliver on the causes of that. Last night put me over the edge. There have been all too many incidents of their slothingly ways of dealing with lines which indicates how little value they have for consumer's time. They get chatty with the customers with long lines making the wait exponentially long over extraneous non essential drivel they placate other customers with. This is fine if there are not others waiting. If there is a line the staff need to move the customers they are with along. Alert them that they need to take the next customer. 
*: I went to pick up my prescription to Walmart Pharmacy in Norwich, CT. The young girl who assisted me was EXTREMELY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. Even the pharmacist gentleman said something to her. When I went back 15 minutes later she was making loud comments about trying to be nice to customers. To what the cashier told her that she needed to be nice. I found it very unprofessional and the fact that people like her are all allowed to work with customers is a shame. I blame this on the manager. I will be taking my business somewhere else where I'm treated with respect.
*: This is a review of the Walmart Pharmacy on South 31th street in Temple, Tx. This place is constantly slow in filling prescriptions, even when called in on the phone. On the morning of September 27 my wife called in a refill and was told it would be ready Saturday after lunch. We check in to pick up the prescription and are told it will be ready in 20 minutes. This is 29 hours after being ordered. Then they close for lunch. After lunch we check in again. We are told it would be 30 minutes. I said, "Bull, that's what you said 45 minutes ago." Response, "We had lunch." My reply was, "Tough, we have better things to do than spend all afternoon in a Walmart store." The prescription was ready in five minutes.. We are taking our business elsewhere.
*: I ordered 3 pills for a cat. The vet was called 8 times by different people, the vet people are returning calls, I called vet because I kept getting notifications that the pharmacy could not get through to them or get a call back, I get told by the vet that they are returning calls. Then, pharmacy tells me they'll try again. I had already cancelled the whole thing to try another place, I tell the pharmacy I cancelled my order and deleted my card. Then, I call to ask about a paper rx. Can't do that, but get told the original order went through, was shipped. How if I cancelled and removed my card information? In fact, I get the order, and my card is charged. HOW? I can't remove my profile and I want it removed. I get the 3 pills, from a Agropet Trading LLC address Miami Lakes, FL., same address as walmartpetrx.com. Agropet is a 3 person firm. associated with Allivet.com, a site exactly like Walmartpetrx.com. What the is going on here???
*: We ordered our dogs prescription medicine from Walmart RX and paid an additional $22 for overnight shipping. Two days later the order still had not shipped. I called Walmart and they said they faxed the order for approval twice but received no response from our vet. I called our vet and they have received no fax requesting approval for the medicine. A professional pharmacy should follow up when they are unable to reach a Veterinarian office via fax instead of letting the ball drop on their customers.
*: I called to check on an item and was on hold for 6 minutes, eventually called back and was rudely told by the pharmacist Mary that if I hang up, "You'll just wait even longer and put back on hold again." So far it's another 7 minutes. If this is SERVICE you can keep it. Call eventually took a total of 18 minutes after 2 holds of 6 and 8 minutes and then I get all the ** about, "Well we just came back from lunch and there's only 3 of us." DO I CARE??!! I think Walmart makes PLENTY of profit. Maybe they need to spend some on improving CUSTOMER (yes we are the ones who pay) SERVICE.
*: The Walmart Pharmacy has quit carrying the generic ** for allergies. I was curious if any of their stores had any left anywhere but I could not find them anywhere. Every time you get a good product, you quit carrying it.
*: I called in two refills to the pharmacy. Hours later, I went to collect the medication. I was told they were in the final stages of getting them ready. 42 minutes left and there was still no medication. I made a complaint to the cashier who in turn got the assistant manager. The assistant manager stated I should wait for phone call to come collect medication. I left the store without cardiac medication and cholesterol medicine. One hour later, there's still no phone call and store closes in 42 minutes. 
*: On Tuesday, Nov. 23, 2010, between 2 and 3 pm, I turned in a prescription to be filled for a family member. I was told there would be several hours wait. I said I would pick it the next day. I returned 24 hours later to pick up the prescription. It was not ready and I was told it would be a 45-minute wait.During this 45 minutes, with a line averaging 8 people for the entire time, two members of the service staff left, and were absent from the pharmacy for more than 35 minutes when I was finally served. 
*: I have been using this store since it opened conveniently next to my home. The pharmacy has often been a problem but approximately every three prescriptions they won't give me a receipt and I have to ask for one. Today, I went to get prescriptions for my mother and myself through the drive-thru window. They were taking a long time, about 15 minutes and I called them and they said the scripts were on the way. Again, there was no receipt so I asked for one. They said that the manager would have to be called and it would take another 15 minutes. It did take almost that and they called and said that my mother's easy pay credit card info was bad and not accepted (when I got home, I checked it on the website and it is correct as well as mine). 
*: On November 6, I went to the Wal-mart pharmacy to pick up medicine that the doctor put me on November 2, but the pharmacy told me that the insurance didn't pay for it so I talked to them and agreed to pay for it. I went to the pharmacy on November 11 but it wasn't ready. I went back on November 16 and they told me it was going to be ready on the 17th. When I went, they told me that they didn't have it but then they said they did. And the person that I talked to told me that I didn't know what I was doing because I didn't order anything there. She told me that I was stupid, idiot, and dumb and other things just because I told her that it was taking too long. So I told her that if she didn't know how to deal with the people then she shouldn't be working there. She said that she didn't care about what happened. I felt so offended that moment so I looked for the manager plus I called to complain.
*: I have been taking ** 25mg for approximately 2 years. When I picked up the new prescription in October, they did not tell me they were giving me 50mg and that I needed to half the pill for the correct dosage. Since I had been taking the medication prior, I did not check the package for instruction. I took the medicine as I had been taking it, one pill per day. When I went back in November to re-fill, they told me it was not time for a re-fill. I asked why. They checked the prescription and told me that my doctor had prescribed the 50mg dose with instructions to half the pill. The pharmacist did not tell me this when I picked the prescription up. Due to the mistake, I have suffered some very uncomfortable side effects. I am now experiencing withdrawals going back to my regular dosage. This could all have been easily avoidable with consultation from the pharmacist or pharmacy technician.
*: Walmart pharmacy in Springhill is the most uncaring, inefficient and dumb bunch of people I have ever dealt with.  I have tried two times to get my prescriptions at this pharmacy and it is always a bunch of unnecessary ** every time I go in there.  I have a bad COPD and they always get the dates wrong on when I can get my medicines.  I am on Medicaid.  I went to get my medicines on 11/9 when I always do and they told me that I couldn't get two of them yet because it had not been 30 days.  The first one was my ** inhaler, the other was my **.
*: The new packaging of your pharmacy products is the worse insult you can make to us seniors. When you get older and have trouble using your hands to push your pills out of a sheet of bubble wrap and they fly on the floor and you have to remove the leftover foil from your pills you will know what I mean. Put the pills back in bottles!  
*: Prescription generic named ** needed to be refilled and MD Oncologist did fill.  However, there was a clerical problem with Cigna which was available on October 1st 2010 and it needed five days to fix the clerical problem.  I called Walmart and they informed me that the generic brand would be $402.03 and I had to pay for this as the insurance wasn't straightened out.  I asked if this is the generic price and they advised yes.  If I wanted five pills of this hormone post chemo medication, they would pro rate.  
*: A prescription was transferred from Wal-Mart in Concord, NC to Wal-Mart in Boone, NC. The exact same insurance information was sent to the pharmacy in Boone. The pharmacy in Boone was attempting to charge 76.00 dollars for an Rx. It has been 24.00 dollars for the past nine months. I concluded this to be fraudulent to overcharge a customer for the exact same Rx within the same company. I immediately transferred the Rx back to Concord where I paid 24 dollars.
*: I turned in 3 prescriptions to the pharmacy. I've been filling my medications at Walmart for about a decade and have filled the exact prescriptions for almost 2 years. I am in their system. The Pharmacist approached me and told me that he knows my doctor and this does not look like his writing. I was also told that they receive a lot of forgeries. I suffer chronic pain and severe panic attacks. I was horrified that he was accusing me of forging a prescription. He caused me to have a panic attack. He called the Doctor and found out that indeed, the prescription was written by my doctor but not before laughing with other pharmacy employees about it. My wife who also suffers extreme anxiety also had a severe anxiety attack over it. The customers inline were staring at us like we were drug addicts and then looking away. My instinct was to take it to another pharmacy but it would have looked like we had forged it. We felt stuck and helpless. 
*: I had a duplicate prescription I had done a little over a year ago. The prescription I have now is fine. I paid $75.00 for it. I went out today to get the prescription filled and they refused to do it. I drove 40 miles to do it. Not happy! She said it was over a year old and didn't have to fill it. What about people who can't afford to go to the eye doctor every year? This is disgusting. Don’t go there! My lenses are blurred and now I have to get a new prescription and will be out the gas and the $75.00 for the new prescription that I already paid for.
*: Went to pick up my prescription's and the Pharmacy was closed (date 10-30-10). Sign indicated the pharmacy would be open from 9am to 7pm. I drove 15 miles to get my medicines and a few other items.
*: My wife had to get a prescription for my 3-week old son for a yeast infection in his mouth called thrush. We had the prescription filled on Friday, October 15. We followed the instructions the pharmacist gave us at the time of the prescription fill up. The pharmacist verified my son’s name before presenting my wife with the medication.
*: I took a prescription for **.  I picked it up, paid for it and when I got it home, the directions told me to take off a clip around the base of the bottle--prime the bottle and take the top off.  There was no clip on this bottle and no cap.  So I took the bottle back today and showed it to them.  The girl told me that I took the clip off and I lost the top.  I asked her if she was calling me a liar and she gave me a lot of mouth.  I thought the head pharmacist should have intervened.  I get all my prescriptions there and used to get them on Palmetto Park Road before they closed, so you know that I have been using Walmart for many years.  I was a businesswoman for many years--retail and wholesale business--and I would never infer that a customer was lying.
*: I went to Wal-Mart Pharmacy this afternoon to get two prescriptions filled.  I specifically told the pharmacist that I would like easy open caps on both bottles.  I was informed it would take approximately 25 minutes to fill my prescriptions.  This was fine with me as I had other shopping to do.  I went to the pharmacy.  While I was waiting for my medication, the pharmacist approached and said that one of my medications was not covered by my insurance.  I asked him to call my insurance company and they would override the system so I could get the medication.  He told me he couldn't do that and if I wanted the script, I would have to pay over $15 for it.
*: Yesterday 10-17-10, I took my niece and nephew to our local emergency room.  The ER physician prescribed two prescriptions to each child.  We arrived at the Wal-Mart pharmacy at 10 minutes till 6:00 pm (the pharmacist said it was five minutes till 6:00 pm) to get the prescriptions filled.  The cashier told my sister-in-law that they could not fill the prescriptions, because they would be closing in five minutes and did not have time.  When my sister-in-law came back to the car and told me what happened, I immediately called the pharmacy.  The cashier answered.  I asked her what time they closed and she stated 6:00.  I asked her, "Why didn't the prescriptions get filled?”  The cashier stated that "several others were ahead of her and that they did not have time to fill any more before the pharmacy closed".
*: At 9:15am today, I dropped off my refills at the pharmacy, and at 7:00pm, went to pick up my medicine. The medicines were not ready so I had to wait 40 minutes while they filled my prescriptions. That is totally unacceptable. I get this same inept and uncaring service almost every time I use that pharmacy. I use that pharmacy because I can do other shopping at the same time. There is a Walgreens and a Rite-Aid at the same traffic light as Walmart. If I continue to get the same poor service, I am going to move my prescriptions and do my other shopping at Kmart and Target. They are all in the same vicinity. This has been an extreme waste of my time and has indeed tested my patience.
*: Over the past 12 months, I have had at least 10 errors with our pharmacy. They tell me my prescriptions are ready. I call before going and they are not. I have had the wrong prescriptions filled also. My main complaint is Quality Control with the tech's, not the pharmacist. We also have unbelievable waiting lines at our pharmacy, many times to finally get to the country then find our prescription not filled as we were told on the phone it would be.
*: The Pharmacy shorted me on my arthritis pain medication by 30 pills. When I asked why, I was told that my insurance would only pay for 60 a month. I asked them to fill the prescription as the doctor had written it and they gave me 30 more pills and charged me for 60 which the pharmacist told me was for 2 months.
*: I paid $160 for an inhaler that is basically useless. I can't even tell that it puts out the medication when I inhale and it certainly has not improved my bronchitis whatsoever. My bronchitis is no better because of their medication. Actually the home remedies I have used are far more effective. I want to know how these companies are allowed to charge exorbitant rates for inferior quality products.
*: Took presciptions for both my husband and myself into the Walmart in Corsicana, Texas. I was told they were about to close for lunch. They would not take my prescriptions. When I returned and the clerk asked if I was going to wait, I was told in store, wait would be an hour or more. I said yes I would wait then I decided not to wait and called my daughter to pick them up on her way home. This was at 2:30pm. At 5:30pm, my order was not ready. It was after 6:30pm before it was ready and then they informed her one order was only a partial. This is not the first time this has happened. They also have told me they have called or faxed the doctor to authorize a generic and when I called the doctor, I was told no, they had not. 
*: Great job! 9/21/10. I needed to price insulin for my dog. Yes, my dog "Fred." I went to the pharmacy. She could not have been more generous with her time and knowledge. I wish I got her name. She explained Wal-Mart worked hard with a company to lower prices for us. To my surprise, she told me the price for the same insulin I have been paying $54.99 plus tax is $24.88. Hats off to you guys! Look at the savings. Thank you very much. My receipt says 9/21/10 10:43 am. So the lady at the pharmacy was there around 10:15 am. Wal-Mart just backed up the commercials.
*: I went to Wal-Mart on 8/20 to pick up my prescription. When I arrived at the counter, the pharmacy tech advised me my prescription was placed back on the shelve and I will need to refill the prescription again. Once I arrived at the counter, the representative advised me the prescription could not be filled because it was expired (however the prescription will not expire until 8/21) upon further research she advised me she could not fill the prescription because the prescription was picked up on 9-8. I proceeded to advised the clerk I did not pick up the prescription and needed to speak to a manager. The pharmacy manager came to the counter and stated there was nothing he could do and the prescription was old anyway.
*: I just left my doctor’s office after being examined for a cracked rib. My doctor decided I needed ** cough syrup to help stop coughing and control some of the pain. Also, he prescribed ** for pain. He also prescribed two other medicines to help control my sugar levels.
*: Planning a vacation over the weekend, I realized that one of my medications was going to run out during the vacation. So on Monday morning, Aug. 30, 2010, I phoned my local Walmart pharmacy to explain my plans for a vacation and how early could I pick up the prescription. I was informed by the pharmacy technician that I could pick it up on Friday, Sept. 3, 2010, so I planned accordingly. On Thursday afternoon, the 2nd, I called Walmart Pharmacy and requested the refill. I was told it would be ready by 11AM Friday, 3rd. Friday, Aug. 3, 2010, I phoned the pharmacy to see if the prescription was ready and was referred to the Pharmacy Manager. The manager informed me that they could not fill the prescription until Sunday, Aug. 5, 2010.
*: I stopped in today Sunday August 29,2010 to pick up a few items and most of all my prescription from the pharmacy. As I approached the pharmacy, there were two customers ahead of me so I waited for my turn to be waited on. After waiting approximately 10 minutes The clerk (Diane) finished waiting on the customer that was ahead of me for some apparent reason stepped over to consultation area leaving me standing there and started talking to one of the employees working in the back who was helping a customer that had just walked up to that window. 
*: The customer service in this pharmacy needs some improvement. The staff is not really friendly, a little disgruntled is the word that fits. It was opening and seeing a huge line waiting for the pharmacy might promote being disgruntled. But this line is also what I want to discuss. At 9.15 am, I was standing in line at the pharmacy. There were 8 people behind me, 5 in front of me and only one cashier. I have been in retail for 20 years and this is not good customer service to have that big line and one cashier. Some people were upset and needing their medidine so they can get to work. Apparently this line and problem is quite common according to others standing in line. Thank you! 
*: Following my 10 month old son's surgery, I dropped off 3 prescriptions to be filled and said I would return for them in a short time. I returned a little less than 2 hours later only to be told that they didn't have 2 of them. One of them was crucial to prevent spasms and pain. They did not bother to call and inform me of this, but said they would locate a pharmacy that could fill the medications. One of the 2 unfilled prescriptions was located and phoned to another pharmacy a common antibiotic that Walmart didn't have! The medication for spasm and pain would have to be located and phoned somewhere else.
*: Wow. my mother went to fill her prescriptions at Wal-Mart like usual and to what a surprise, more problems every time-- but this last time, I thought corporate should know. My mother had a 30day ** script that had no refills and her new script was a 90 day script. They filled filled the 30 instead. What are they doing? Do they know how to do their job? We called and had that problem fixed but my main concern is Dr. ** prescribed her 180 vials of ** which ends up being 540 ml. Well the pharmacist keeps giving my mom 180 ml instead which is only 60 vials and only lasted my mom bout two weeks. When we bring it up to the pharmacist to have filled, they refused to give her 180 vials, only 180 ml and their response is, "Well, your doctor is wrong. 180 vials is too much."
*: I went to Walmart to fill my wife's prescriptions. I needed to refill her ** 70mg and her vitamin D 50k tablets. I was told that I would have to come back for the ** because it was too early for them to be able to refill. They could refill the vitamin D however. I don't believe this as both prescriptions were given to her by the doctor on the same day and both were previously filled by the same Walmart on the same day. I believe it is a tactic used by Walmart to force customers to come back to Walmart stores. The more you are at Walmart the more you will spend there.
*: I went to pick a prescription today 8/19/10 that had been called in two days preceding. I was kept waiting at the drive through for 30 minutes before I got my prescription. The people at the pharmacy said my call went to Houston and they had not processed it yet and that they were understaffed and busy and had not processed it yet. 
*: Why can't I find vitamin easily? Why abandon alpha numeric stockin' and sectionalizing Vitamins? I have extreme difficulty finding the Vitamins I am looking for. D**b, d**b, d**b! I noticed others are using the "Biblical system," seek and perhaps ye shall find! 
*: I went into the Walmart pharmacy to get my prescription filled as I have for the previous 5 months. I handed the lady my prescription, she looked at it and said they cannot fill it because it was not from that town. I recently moved from Largo, FL up to Crawfordville, FL in February 2010. I told her they had filled it since March. She said they have a new policy; they will not fill any prescription that isn't from a local doctor. My doctor that I've been seeing for the past 12 years is located in Okeechobee, FL. He has been the only doctor that has been able to help me and I was fortunate to find him. 
*: I live a couple blocks from this pharmacy. I spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars in medication every month, but I am getting so upset with the poor customer service this pharmacy has. Every time when someone comes to drop off a prescription, you can stand waiting and waiting in front of the technician at the window. And if they are doing something on the computer or doing something else, they will ignore you and they will not greet the person by saying hello or hi to you; they will not even say, "I will be right with you." I think that for a place like this, they should have better, courteous personnel. The clerks at pick up end, they are really nice; but the pharmacy techs have no customer service at all.
*: It takes a lot for me to take the time to write and make a complaint but I have just had it with your service, it's the worst.
*: I went in to the store on Friday, July 23. to pick up a refill prescription that I had called in. The woman running the register couldn't find the refill. I asked if there was a problem and I was presented with 2 duplicate receipts from prescriptions I had picked up on July 12 and July 16. They claimed that I had not paid for the 2 prescriptions. I was stunned and asked them how that could possibly happen when they were run through the register with my weekly grocery purchases. The woman said, "Well, sometimes the cashiers fail to scan the prescriptions." I asked her how that makes the error my fault.
*: On 07/18/2010, I had medication filled, pain meds and medicine for my stomach. I had heard that Wal-Mart would not give all the meds to you to count them before you left the store. Well, they are right. They gave me 10 pills when I was supposed to get 20 and yes they were of the pain pills. So calling anybody does no good at all their fingers do not work, maybe that's why they cannot count. They cannot use the buttons on the phone either it is ** that I am writing this and I still have not heard from Walmart. Even though I am in pain, there is a happy camper in Wal-Mart somewhere. Wal-Mart you suck. I tell everybody about this so they can count their meds. I put it on Facebook so many have been cheated out of there meds. Shame on you Wal-Mart.
*: I have Medicaid medically needy which means each month I must submit my unpaid medicines document to DCF. In order to receive the document from the pharmacy, I bring my driver's license, I have to go there in person because my signature is also needed. On my first attempt on 7-1-10, all of my medications were not on the report. So after explaining the error to the tech, I was told I would have to call on the next day to rectify error. I called in 6 Rx's to be refilled not 5, called back on 7-2-10 thinking I had given them time enough
*: In all, three errors were made after I had my daughter's and my prescription transferred to the Walmart. My prescription clearly stated 20 mg of **. But their staff instructed me to cut the tablet in half even though each tablet is 20 mg. On that same day, once I received this prescription and another, they both are labeled under my 12-year old daughter's name, not mine.  
*: My doctor called in a prescription for me at 10:30AM, and was told that it would be ready in one hour.  I arrived at Wal-Mart at 1PM and was told that it was not ready and it would be about another half hour.  Of course, I was a little upset.  I hung around for another hour and went to the pharmacy to pick up my prescription and was told that it still wasn't ready and it would be a few more minute.  Needless to say, I left pissed off.  
*: This is the second experience I have had with this pharmacy. This one was serious enough to report to the FDA. I, for the second time, was given a quote of $4.68 for my daughter’s asthma inhaler. I dropped it off to be filled. It was to be dispensed for two inhalers. When my husband arrived to pick them up, he was quoted $84.00$! I work in healthcare so he called me. I spoke to the pharmacist who first tried to blame it on the new staff. When I told her that I spoke to the same staff member 4 weeks prior, she then used the reason that the cost was $4.68 a gram! Really? I have never heard of dispensing an asthma inhaler by grams. They are dispensed by units! Well, Walmart, you have done it again, ripping off customers!
*: On 7/13/10 at 3:30 pm, I turned in a prescription to be filled for my son. The prescription is a premixed oral antibiotic rinse. I was told it would take 30 minutes. I came back and waited in line again. The lady yelled at me that it wasn't done and told me it would take 15 minutes more. I came back 15 minutes later and waited in line an extra 15 minutes, only to be barked at again that it wasn't ready. The pharmacist decides to fill mine, finally. When the counter lady gave it to me, she didn't run my insurance and told me that the prescription was cheap enough and she wasn't running it. My children have state aide that I pay a monthly premium for (not free). She refused twice to run the insurance. 
*: At 8 am, I called in a refill and went to pick it up at 2:30 pm. I was told it wasn't ready but in the process; they would announce when ready. I sat and waited for 20 min and thought I might have missed it and waited in line. (There's always a line!) And when I got to desk, I was told it was in the process of fill. I wandered around for 15 min, didn't hear my name, so I went to the desk. 
*: This pharmacy is having difficulty processing my wife's medication prescription.  Our insurance hasn't decided on coverage, yet my wife still needs her medication.  So we pay out-of-pocket and when I say that, the idiots will not process the prescription or will delay for as long as three days.  Because of this, my wife has gone at least a week without her medication.  This has been going on for the last three months and they still don't get it.
*: I changed my prescriptions from CVS to Walmart about six months ago to save some money.  Since there are several (7), I try to get them filled at the same time.  Every single time, there has been something wrong.  Either they are not all ready, they have run out of the medication, or they only have the medication in blister packs.  And today (which broke the camel's back), they couldn't find one of my medicines in their system.  Even though three months ago, they refilled it and I showed them their bottle!  They said that I would have to call the doctor and get another sent.  Needless to say, I did call the doctor.
*: On 4-19-10, My daughter went to Walmart to fill a script for ** 1G while I was in the hospital. They did not have it but, they said that the policy was to fill scripts generically but if that was not available to fill it with the name brand at the same price. They refused to do this and I had to return the next day for the generic. I had been sick with shingles since the 12 of April, but only confirmed on the 4-19-10. My daughter returned to the hospital and was given a script for another anti-viral. This didn't work well at all. As of July 8, I am still suffering with shingles. And I believe that if I had gotten the script that I needed at the right time, my case of shingles would not be so bad.
*: I am diabetic and noticed that I was paying a co-payment for my test strips and lancets. Medicare always sends my supplement company (Physician's Mutual) notification to pay any extra that Medicare doesn't pay. Physician's Mutual has been paying Walmart the money but so have I. Physician's Mutual says I need to get the money back from Walmart and they say contact the insurance company. Walmart got the money twice so I would like my money back. So far to me it has only been about $25.00 but I can't be the only one who has this problem.
*: I received my medication ** on June 25th, 2010. Six of my pills were missing out of my bottle. I would like this reported to the pharmacist board being it is the same lady as the one who took my friend’s medicines. I think she has a problem and makes Walmart here look terrible. I will be changing my pharmacist after my other 2 refills. Mine is worker’s comp and I am 64 years old.
*: The pharmacist took 4 of my refills off of my **. I reported to my doctor. I had to pay $280.00 to get my refills redone by T.B Darji.
*: With Wal-Mart having the deals on prescriptions, they sure lack the ability to hire the appreciate people behind the counter at the South Point Store. I went in to get my medication filled and of course got the run around yet again. The male pharmacist at that time was rude in answering me. When I got home I thought I should have got his name and called to obtain that. He told me the person that answered it was none of my business and I told them it was. He called me back and told me that I didn't need his name and for me to never come into that store again. I reminded him that he has to give his name for he is the very one that keep us alive. I realize these pharmacists go to school almost as long as a doctor but if they choose to play doctor, then they should have done just that. They can not trump my script just because of a bad day and then call me to tell me not to return. 
*: I wish to complain about the blue plastic trays which contain many meds today. It is very difficult to extract the meds when one’s arthritis is acting up. The trays are also very cumbersome to travel with. The bottles are much easier and I would think much cheaper.
*: My complaint is about an incident dated 11/17/09 during which a pharmacist, Brian K., employed at the Wal-Mart store located in Warminster, PA refused to give me a proper and courteous service. Instead, he and the security guard on duty subjected me to extreme insults and humiliation. When I approached the manager on duty, he crudely disregarded my request to have a joint meeting of all involved to resolve the problem. Instead, this manager sided with his employees and further joined them in their malicious assault. There have been two other incidences in which the same pharmacist had intimidated me in front of other people making the 11/17/09 incidence the third assault on me from him. Completely frustrated and depressed by the incident, I filed a written complaint with the Customer Relations Manager, Wal-Mart Corporate Offices on 11/22/09.  A copy of my 11/22/09 complaint to Wal-Mart Corporate Office is herewith attached to describe the incidence in detail which I urge you to read first. 
*: I went to this pharmacy to have a ** prescription filled and the pharmacist said that my prescription was out of date and the date was not to fill before 5-23-2010. This was on 5-26-2010 and I said that that the new law was there is a 21 day time limit in this now and she said, "What are you, stupid?" And then I called my doctor's assistant and she faxed the law to her,  pharmacist head. While she was waiting on the fax, I told her I would wait. My doctor's assistant Dianne called her the pharmacist and was talking to the pharmacist and the pharmacist ask if I am Jack ** and was some kind of hillbilly from the country and told Dianne that I was stupid and I don't understand what was going on. 
*: Medicine called several times not ready. Hours later, not ready. Sometimes the next day not ready. lots of times don/t even have what needed. sometimes needed at the day turned in. making several trips to get medicine. For example, wife needed a prescription couch medicine today 6/2/10. I was told it would be 6/5/10, before they would have it.
*: On Sunday May 23, 2010 I went to Wal-Mart to fill a prescription and the pharmacy was closed for lunch, what’s this? The whole department is gone to lunch. What about the customer? Is the entire store going to start closing for lunch? This is poor customer relations. I call Wal-Mart for a prescription refill; it takes 24 to 48 hours to get it. I can call my local grocery store in the morning and get it that afternoon, shame on you Wal-Mart pharmacy, your store isn't that big that I have to shop there.
*: On 1/30/2010, I purchased my blood glucose strips and was told I must pay for the coverage at the time of visit even though I explained I have coverage for my medicines with no deductible or co-pay due to my insurance coverage. Well, I had to pay the 77.56. I have now received my explanation of benefits from medicare that this had been approved and paid by my insurance company so I due a reimbursement of 77.56. I went through this last year and was told I had to wait for 3 months. Well, I now have my notification and would like my reimbursement as the money is just as good in my pocket as it is in Walmart's. Please handle this as soon as possible. Thank you.
*: I called at 3pm to get a prescription filled. The tech told me they weren't filling anymore prescriptions, I would have to wait until the following day. I have CHF/Cardiomyopathy and have had my prescriptions filled at several Walmart stores over the past 3 years and that has never happened. I spoke to the Pharmacist on Duty and she told me that she had over 200 prescriptions ahead of me and that is why she would not be able to fill my order before 9pm. She couldn't even give me a couple pills to get me through the wait time. Unacceptable! I had to drive out of my way to get my prescription filled. I will not do business at that store again!
*: I've been trying to get a straight answer about a medication. I've dropped off a prescription, they say they won't have it for a week. I go back in a week, and it was still not ready, and I was told they need another week to fill it. I talked to the regional manager, who told me their policy is two days to fill prescription. I went elsewhere to get my medication, only to go back to Walmart, but nothing has still been resolved. Who do I believe? If it was an important person or a Walmart employee, would they get it faster? Does anybody care about their services or reputation, why can't anybody give a straight answer so that people on disability can find help elsewhere. Why advertise if you can't keep your promise? 
*: I started using Walmart Pharmacy about five months ago and the 90% of this time, I have had to deal with the girl by the name of Tanisha. The rudest girl I have ever had to deal with. Two months ago, I picked my medicine up (muscle relaxer) to find out the next day that all were gone except for three (total of 60 count). My wife and I panicked thinking that somehow our three-year old son had gotten into them, only to find out after extensive search in the house that Walmart shorted me the prescription without letting me know. I called to complain that they should have told me. Of course, I get this same Tanisha girl that is rude to me once more. 
*: I have experienced many problems with Walmart No. 3489 located in Rosedale, MD. The only reason I am writing is because I have left this store on three separate occasions crying and with good reasons. My problems started one day during the snowstorm this past winter. I could not have my prescriptions filled because I didn't have all my insurance information. This information could have been accessed through the computer. This was the least of my problems. I was changing insurance companies and most of my prescription refills had to be transferred from Medco, a mail order pharmacy. After dropping off one of the prescription bottles on a Friday afternoon, I was told by the pharmacist that transfers could not be done on weekends. He explained that it is too difficult to reach the appropriate people. So I returned on Monday going without my ** all weekend. In another time, I dropped off my bottle to be transferred and was told it would take 24 hours and it was store policy. I told the technician that I just got off the phone with the Medco Pharmacy and it would take less than five minutes for the entire transaction. He still refused to call.
*: I have been buying a product called ** for many years at the Walmart in Castle Rock, CO. I take it as a calcium source and now, for no apparent reason, it has been dropped from their order. This is the only place that I have been able to find this item and I am very unhappy that I can no longer get it.
*: My wife and I both get a prescription for ** at the WalMart Pharmacy in Carson City. This particular prescription is purchased in bulk form by Wal Mart and packaged by International Labs, St. Petersburg, FL in the worst and most difficult form of packaging possible. It is a blister pack sufficient for 30 days and the blister pack is enclosed in a rigid plastic shell. The package is very difficult and disagreeable to use. As a former packaging engineer, I find this to be a terrible waste of packaging materials. What's wrong with a simple pill bottle at time of dispensing? A couple of disgruntled customers.
*: I don't know if there's anything wrong with this or not, but its kind of weird.  I picked up my prescription today.  I didn't really look at it until a little after 1:00 am.  I have seen something odd.  It was another label under my label.  My medicine that I just picked up, had a label on it for someone else.  I have this guy's information, age, his doctors, how many refills he has left, etc.  I don't think this is very professional, and it can be risky on my behalf.  It makes me wonder if someone could have tampered with the contents inside.
*: I went today, 4/28/2010, to pick up my mother’s medicines and was informed that they no longer will take the time to put the pills in a bottle at our request for someone her age and disability. The clerk’s exact words were, “We have 600 or more customers a day and if we do that for all, we would be behind schedule on everything.” Well, my whole point to them is if my mother cannot get into her medication, then she will be less likely to have that medicines. Clearly, I was disappointed by the way the situation has been handled. It’s been this way for months. We are going to be switching to another pharmacy for all of her scripts. 
*: I have a severe back problem.  I have had two MRIs done via proof.  My doctor prescribed me ** for pain relief control.  I have dealt with Walmart pharmacy for one year for all the medicines.  The last two months, they say, "We don't have it," and handed me the script back.  ''Tough," they say.  I thought their job was to take care of person's needs by making sure they can have medicines on hand for patients in Alaska.  We count on them up here because there are hardly any other places to go.  They have let me down and couldn't care less in their attitude towards me!
*: This is not a specific incident.  Since Walmart has cut back on all of its help, the pharmacy service has been bad.  One tech dropped a whole lot of prescriptions on the floor.  He just threw his hands up, and walked through them.  The next time, we waited so long for our prescription, over an hour, and the pharmacist gave us the $4.00 prescription free.  The fault is with Walmart, not with its people. 
*: Please check into the Pharmacy at Osceola Store #4606. On 4/5/10, I called at 9:00 a.m. for 4 presp. and the girl told me they would need a fax from the Doctor. She said I'm faxing it right now. I called back at noon and they didn't have the fax yet. I called my Doctor's office and they did not receive the fax but the nurse said what medicine do you need and I will fax it right away. At 3:00 p.m., I wend to get my medicine and they said they didn't get the fax and I said the nurse fax it to you at noon. 
*: The prescription was called in on a Thursday. My husband went to pick it up on Friday, 9:00 AM. When he arrived, they said it had not been called in. My doctor's assistant said, they had, and even gave the name of who they spoke to, so they called it in again. They told my husband it would be ready in 40 minutes. I went to pick it up at 1:30 and they were extremely rude, and said it was ready. After I waited for a while, and asked if it was ready or not, I heard the pharmacist tell the clerk (Monica) tell her it isn't, and to come back after lunch.
*: I took in a new prescription. It was filled, but I realized after I left the store that the pharmacist didn't talk to me about the prescription, I didn't go back in. After I got home, I read the information that came with it, opened the bottle, and took a pill. I then read the warnings on the bottle when I then realized this wasn't my prescription. It wasn't my name on the bottle, and it wasn't the same medicine. 
*: When I went to pick up my glasses, I was given a pair that were absolutely the wrong color and size. When I put them on, they were so strong I couldn't see my hand in front of my face. The attendant insisted that I wear them and that my eyes would adjust eventually. I tried that and told her several times that I could not see. She told me in an angry tone that I have ordered them, so now, I was going to have to wear them.
*: I called in to have my prescription refilled on Tuesday and told the person on the phone that this time I wanted the brand name not the generic. On Wednesday, I called to see if the script was ready and the auto check thing said that they needed to talk to me about my order so I did. They told me that my order was out of refills and to speak with my doctor. I told them yes, I know. I was just at the doctor last week and was okay for another year. They said I was to speak with the doctor and have him call in the refill. I called the doctor's office and they said no, they don't call in refills. The pharmacy faxes in a refill request.
*: Well, he was rude to customers. He leaves the pharmacy without another one in it which is against the law. He told a lady he can only sell one but go to another one and get more. He yells at other employees. The mangers at Walmart refuse to do anything about it I hear. He gave people the wrong medicine. My opinion is he is a very bad pharmacist and can really hurt someone by giving wrong meds. But he covers that up.
*: I am a cancer patient that has a prescription for ** for pain. My doctor will only give this to me a certain amount at a time. In my case it is 60 pills per prescription. The last few times, it seemed that I was running out of pills before the allotted time. This time, I got a brand new prescription filled for 60 pills and I counted them and there are only 52 pills in the bottle. That is 4 days of medication for me.
*: I had a ridiculous experience with Walmart Pharmacy today. I ordered a prescription on 02/26/2008, they said the medication is not available and it needs to be ordered. We said okay because I have to start my medication from 03/17/2010, otherwise I should have went to some other pharmacy. The ordered quantity was 15 injections; I have to take this injection everyday one from 3/17/2010, so I thought I have some time so I asked them to order the injection. On 03/12/2010, I went to the store to collect the medication (before that, I called about the order but very poor response over the phone). When I went to pick up the order, I received only 5 injections (1 box) instead of 15 (3 boxes), each box contains 5 injections. After coming home, I realized that there were only 5 injections. 
*: I called in a refill the day before my prescription expired. The system told me it was in stock and would be ready the next day. With the storms closing roads, taking out power and flooding my basement, I didn't have time to get the script until this evening. Before I drove out, I got a call from the pharmacy. The guy told me that they tried to fill the script today and couldn't because it was expired. They called my doctor who said I need to come in for a visit. I asked, "why are you filling it today?". He replied that it was out of stock. I asked why the system said it was in stock and got blown off? I asked, "Don't you call and tell people when something is out of stock?". A flat "no" was his reply. 
*: I refilled my prescription order by phone early in the day yesterday and found that I had to wait until today, Sunday, to pick it up. It was supposed to be ready afternoon. But when I went in (and waited first in a long line to return an item) the pharmacy was closing and the obnoxious pharmacist said they were going to lunch now. It was about 1:30. The pharmacy was closed. It would open in half an hour. They closed the pharmacy? What? Is this some scheme to get people to wander around their store so they'll buy more? Walmart considers us to be two-dimensional stick-figures to be controlled. No way! I am not stupid, Walmart. That's outrageous.
*: On December 14th 2009, I went to the doctor and he had renewals called into the above pharmacy on all of my prescriptions from him. They failed to renew all of them from this doctor. They had to call his office for the renewals. I had to wait for my prescription. For days now, I have been back to the doctor again last March 8, 2010. 
*: On Monday, March 1, 2010, I left a prescription to be refilled.  They only had part of it, but they said that they would mail it to me by Wednesday.  On Monday, March 8, I called to see what happened.  I talked to Jason, the manager of the pharmacy, and told him the problem.  I was a bit upset, and after a few exchanges of information, I asked him if there was any apology for the mistake.  He said I didn't give him a chance to apologize.  I told him that if they were really interested in the problem, an apology should be the first thing out of his mouth.  He insisted that I didn't give him a chance, and he didn't have to take my abuse.
*: On the busy day Saturday, the pharmacy closes from 1:30 to 2:00 because they say only one pharmacist is on duty at 2:00. The people were lined up 15 or 20 to pick up meds. We came back at 2:30, same, at 3pm still lined up. I went home without meds. This is stupid to close on this busy time in retail business for 30 years. I wouldn't dream of closing then. Neither would some I bet.
*: On Monday March 1st 2010, I placed an order for my 90-year old mother's prescriptions. I was told they would be ready at 3 pm. We arrived at the Walmart at 3:15 pm and stood in line for at least 20 minutes. When we arrived at the desk, we were told that the prescriptions were not ready and in fact, one they did not have in stock. We were told one of the prescriptions would be filled shortly, the other, we could possibly find another Walmart that could fill the prescription or we could come back tomorrow and stand in line and maybe they would have it. 
*: My doctors office was out of samples of a medication I was taking to see if they were right for me. They called in a prescription at the Independence WalMart. I went to pick it up today and asked the man in the pharmacy if there was a charge. He said, “Yes, unless you want it on a insurance card.” I said I don't have insurance but my doctors was out of samples to see if this medication would be right for me. He said I better call my doctor because they don't give samples out. I said okay.
*: I recently bought a new blood glucose monitoring system, the ReliOn brand. The ReliOn brand test strips are cheaper. This was on February 12, 2010. They were out of the test strips. I thought nothing about it. They're always getting shipments. I'll come back in a few days. 
*: I went to Walmart pharmacy, and the pharmacists are very, very rude and have no problem telling you that they are too busy, and they get busy there and things happen, such as they lost my prescriptions not one time but 5 times. On top of that, they give me ** that was not mine to begin with. I am allergic to the drug. I tried to give it back to them they said what are you trying to do, I said look I am allergic to this, and its not mine! Overlooking what I said, the clerk said well just give me the one pill back and you can have the rest of them, filling my prescriptions they charged me 5.00 for 3 prescriptions that were not mine! The second time called in to get my **, they said it was not on file. 
*: I went to the ER and was kept overnight. Diagnosed with blood clots and when I was discharged I had an Rx for **. I was medicated and distressed when I left the hospital. My mother drove me to Walmart and we filled the Rx for $905.32 (I do not have medical insurance) and to be sure we had everything we needed, my mother went back to fill the second Rx for $1,267.32. Then the blood test results were returned and found I did not need the **. I did not open or tamper with the packaging. I have found that ** has a program where it would not have cost me anything.
*: I was prescribed a medication by my doctor for chronic pain. I was prescribed a nasal spray and the same in an injectable form. I had been on the nasal form for years, then the doctor added the injectable form. Walmart had no problem filling the prescription; I asked for the needles that went along with the meds, they sold me needles with an orange top. I didn't know one type of needle from another; needless to say I didn't ask any questions. 
*: I dropped prescription at Walmart on Feb. 23 around 5PM. They told me to pick it up after 8:30PM or after 8:30AM today. Well, we got there at 11AM. The prescriptions were never filled. It was for 2 new medications. I really don't accept their apologies. I was not able to start my medication on time. I'm very upset. We will use CVS. At least, I don't have to wait so many hours to get my medications. Sorry, but the store is in Mt. Dora, FL. 
*: I went to pick up my Rx at Wal-mart a day later than it was supposed to be ready. There was only 1 of 3 ready. The girl very snippy said, "I just have one. You'll have to call the doctor." I said fine and called my doctor before leaving the store. I was told that my doctors office faxed all 3 of my Rx's on the same sheet. I then went back to the pharmacy to tell them. Gale who was very helpful, pulled the fax, and said, "Yes, 3 are here." 
*: I took prescription for trazodone on February 16, refill. I have been back 3 times. I still do not have it. I was told they had 5 pills partial prescriptioin for me. I waited 20 minutes but they could not find it. I went by today, still no pills! What's up?!
*: This is the worst pharmacy in the entire country. They couldn’t care less about customer service and the manager is a total jerk. He has a pharmacy technician that is known locally as a junky and she works the front desk. The worst story I have to tell could have actually killed my roommate. My roomy is diabetic and is on injectable medication for his disease. Get this, he starts feeling weak and was out of his medication because he didn’t have the money to get his medication. 
*: This was not my first problem with the technical people who work in the pharmacy. They have no clue how to work with the public. Walmart prides itself on customer service but it does not exist in this pharmacy. The customer is not treated with respect. We had an issue with the pricing of the prescription and the insurance. After getting the issue corrected with the clinic, we proceeded to have it filled and once again there was a problem. The pharmacy tech along with the pharmacist talked to me as if I were a stupid child. I cannot abide such treatment. I will no longer use the Walmart Pharmacy. All of the prescriptions that I have and members of my family are being removed from the store.
*: I dropped my prescription off, and they told me it would be ready in about a half an hour and that they would page me and let me know because I explained I was in the middle of a doctor visit and had to pick them up quick and return to my appointment. So I walked around Wal-mart, just wasting time and listening for my name. After an hour, I thought they must have just forgot to call my name.
*: My pain prescription medications have been consistently short. Walmart has placed the blame on me when my medication was short. This has happened on a regular basis and at various locations, leading me to believe this is a widely employed practice. I have been having my pain meds counted-out upon receipt. However, when my wife picks up the prescription, she often fails to have them count the meds in person. I would like to hear from others who have had this same issue with Walmart. 
*: On Feb. 10th at about 6:00PM, I took 2 prescriptions to the pharmacy to be filled. As they were very busy, the clerk told me that it would be about an hour wait. I shopped and got dinner at Subway in the store. I came back in an hour and was told they were not ready yet and was asked to wait another 15 minutes. When I went to the counter, the clerk told me they could only fill one as they could not find the other prescription. I told her I definitely gave the previous clerk 2 prescriptions. She asked me if I just wanted to take the first. I said no! I was asked to move over and wait another 15-20 minutes while they searched for my missing prescription. They finally found it.
*: On 02/10/2010, I filled a prescription from my spine pain management doctor for ** 15 mgs., 60 tabs, take one twice daily.  When I got home with the prescription, I counted the tablets (AARP recommends this). There were only 50 tablets given to me. I had paid $34.45 for the 60 pills.  The following morning, I went to the pharmacy with my prescription, and explained what had happened. I was told that was unfortunate. I asked if they had their own counts, that they could check this against, see if they were showing ten extra pills. This was done, and I was told that the count was exactly right. They had exactly the number of pills that they should have. I asked if there was someone that I could talk to with more authority. The pharmacist said no, there was no one else. 
*: I went to pick up a prescription for my son last week because he had been sick. I seen this Kristy girl when I was picking up the meds. She asked me what was wrong and proceeded to blurt out that when she feels bad, she smokes weed or dope (whatever you call it) right in front of my son. My family is a Christian family and I didn't want my son to hear that type of comment. Not to mention, I worry about someone smoking dope at a pharmacy where I get my son's medications from. Please solve this problem. 
*: I left two prescriptions for refill on Tuesday, January19, 2010. The personnel who took the order said that one had run out of refills and that the doctor would be notified. On Friday, January 22, 2010, I returned to pick up the medications, only to be told that the doctor's office had not responded to their request of authorization to refill **. The doctor's office closed at noon on Friday, so I waited until this morning to call and was told that the fax had been answered the day it was received (if it had been received). The doctor's office called me at about 11:30 am and said they had sent in the refill OK.
*: On 2010-01-21, I went to have a prescription fill up. Pharmacist said waiting time was 2 hours. It was to late for pickup, we left the prescription. I came back on the 2010-01 22 to pick up the prescription at 4pm. The pharmacist said that they didn't have the type of medication in the prescription. They have the 9 hours to call me and let me know but they just didn't call me. I got very upset because if this was an emergency, I would have died waiting for them to call. This particular Wal-Mart has the most lousy service ever. They shouldn't operate a Pharmacy if they don't care about their consumers.
*: My doctor called in to the above pharmacy an emergency prescription for two (2) vials ** 70/30 insulin which I needed immediately.  I approached the counter to pay for this medication and I observed, as I had observed for over two years, that there was again only one register open and a very long line of people waiting for desperately needed medications.  Going to the unused register, I counted nine (9) people, besides the pharmacist doing pretty much nothing in the pharmacy area.
*: I was treated like a junkie off the street by this floater pharmacist and put all my meds on hold and requested my pain management to do some sort of orez report. I was talked to in front of customers and staff like a junkie and then again on the phone when indeed the report did come back and all my Rx info was correct and legitimate.
*: I waited 10 minutes to drop off Rx and went to pick it up next day. Only one Rx was filled. I came back next day and it’s not ready. Then they gave me a double dose pill and told me to break it in half and took another 35 minutes to fill. Not professional. I wanted to ask questions about drug interactions. My doctor told me to take one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Wal-Mart’s instructions said once a day on each. I have to call back the doctor to get correct instructions. I’ll never go back to Wal-Mart.
*: I get my prescriptions filled at the Walmart Pharmacy in Cody, WY. Most of the prescriptions come in those blue packet containers and I can't open them and they won't let any of the employees open them for me. I have bad hands and no one can tell me any way to get them open.
*: I have had several problems with this pharmacy saying prescriptions were ready when they were not and having an attitude that we should be damn glad they bother to wait on us. But when it concerns my elderly mother, it's just different for me. I usually order online now just to avoid any actual contact with these people. I would use another pharmacy, but none of the others have prices we can afford. I had ordered one medication twice online and it still showed that it had not been requested. 
*: I was told that the ** 2.5mg would cost $4.00. The person that picked up the prescription was charged $16.00. I am disabled or I would not have taken the prescription.
*: On December 4, 2009, my doctor prescribed me **, anti-inflammatory, due to joint pain.  The prescription called for one tablet a day for first week, two tablets a day for the second week, and then three tablets a day on the third week.  My prescription was filled at Walmart Pharmacy in Rockwall, Texas.  On December 9, 2009, my prescription was filled and I began taking the medicine on December 14th after battling a cold.
*: I felt bad on Saturday after all the eating and found that I had no test strips for my meter (Freestyle Lite) which is around $50. I sent my wife to Wal-Mart. At this store, due to traffic, they ended up selling her $100 worth of stuff I have piles and piles of. Anyway, she fought through the traffic and came home with new pile of stuff for twice of what I needed and they were the wrong strips. Well, I burned two strips in wrong meter or wrong test strips, you tell me. Well, my condition got worse and I told her go to Walgreens to get things straight. I had it right but got wrong stuff from Wal-Mart. I'm sticking wrong strips into the wrong meter and they only took the wrong test strips back, all the traffic and heartache caused by Wal-Mart and loss money, never again.
*: I went in 12/21 after having an inhaler called in on 12/16. They were not ready as they had a question regarding insurance. I asked why no one had called me as I had told them in the past that I pay for the inhalers I purchase locally. I had an appointment I had to be shortly and thought I was just picking up the Rx quickly. I had also told them in the past that the ** inhaler does not work for me. My doctor's office sent an order for 2 ** inhalers. As I waited, the pharmacist filled the order and put both inhalers in the bag and stapled it shut. Being on a disability pension and not even being able to get all the Rx I need monthly, I was shocked to be told it was $88.54. I paid and had to leave as I was going to be late on my appointment by that time. 
*: This is an addendum to the original complaint earlier today. When my husband attempted to pick up the ** today, he was told that they were out of stock and to try back tomorrow after 3pm. He asked to have the script transferred to the Walmart down the road and he was told that was illegal. I then called the Walgreens across the street. The pharmacist there called Walmart, transferred the ** Rx, and filled it immediately. Cheers to Walgreens!
*: I have been a long time customer of Walmart and get my prescriptions filled there. The first time I got my prescriptions filled there, the associate had and attitude because there was so many to fill. I take over nineteen medications and I had just seen a new physician and she prescribed them all at once. I recently got a third of my prescriptions filled. I called them in the night before and the computer told me that they would be ready the next day at 10 am. I waited until 3:30 the next day to give them extra time. To my surprise, when I got there, they told me that it would be another 30 minutes because there were so many.
*: I went to this pharmacy on Thursday, Dec. 17, 2009 and asked to refill my ** because I was going to be admitted to the hospital the next morning for surgery. I was told it was too early and that I couldn't get it until Monday, Dec. 21st. That would be 30 days. I asked about the 2-day leeway rule and was told that I had already tried to refill the ** earlier that month. I explained that that had been an error. I had asked my son to read me the refill number off my ** and that I went to pick it up. He had given me the number off ** bottle. I corrected that mistake and had my ** filled. The pharmacist became short with me and I began feeling guilty for requesting the refill. I left. 
*: My doctor just put me on a new medication because I could not afford my original prescription. Well I got on the $9 program at Walmart pharmacy with the **. Let me just say that the medicine is a big waste of my money. It does not stop an asthma attack. I am still left with shortness of breath and the tight felling in my chest, plus the product only has 64 doses. Well I used my samples that my doctor gave me. Not really happy about the medicine, but it is the only thing I can afford. So I called my local Walmart pharmacy to fill my prescription. I got the medicine and went to use it. Well no help at all with my attack. Really, it wasn't helping at all. 
*: I first asked someone at the pharmacy what my meds would cost if I changed over to their store, I was told about $80.00. I went in with an empty bottle with all the info on it so they can transfer my prescription from another named store to this one. They read the bottle and filled out the prescription information onto a fax page to send to my doctor for the transfer. And again, I asked the cost of the meds and was told about $80.00. The transfer went through but I was told the cost was now $117.00, up $37.00. I told the person in charge and they said I had to pay the money. I told them I would have stayed with the other named store because I got it there for $95.00. 
*: Overall description - This happens 90% of the time. It cause me to have to go back at least twice each time and go to my doctor's to call again for medication. I went to another pharmacy and never had problems like this. I have talked to the manager and called the company.
*: My 84 year old mother gets her prescriptions filled there and they usually treat her well because she is a little old lady. However when it comes to doing their job with care and efficiency they lack a lot. When my mother would take in a prescription to be filled they would have her wait for almost always 2 hours. The other day she phoned it in and they told her it would be ready after 2PM. I went to pick it up at 5 PM and they said that it wasn't ready because they were out of it. This is medication she needs and they fill that prescription there all the time but they didn't bother to call her or me or my sister. 

*: everytime i go there i have to wait a hour our longer for my scripts,or if i call them in i am lucky if they are ready the next day which usually they are this is the worst prescription place i have ever been and the employees are rude.or you dont get all your scripts.
*: There have been a number of occasions where the Walmart Pharmacy failed to follow-up on prescription refill requests. Rather than take any responsibility to provide me with my prescription medication, they continue to blame either me or my physicians. But the fact is that my doctors have provided consistent notice to the pharmacy for ALL refills and new prescriptions. Their negligence has put my health in jeopardy far too often. If the staff and pharmacists at Walmart cannot do their jobs properly, they should seek a different type of employment. I do not consider my health concerns to be a joking matter. In the future, I expect the staff to be accountable, professional and "human." 
*: Picked up a prescription this afternoon at 2:15 pm.  Went home took medication as directed after reading information supplied.  Shortly after started feeling bad and had a pretty bad headache.  I had to run my daughter to a friends house for the night and left around 8:30.  My son called my cell and said that someone called the house at 8:45 and needed me to call the pharmacist about a prescription I had picked up today.  I came right home and called because of my headache and not feeling well I thought maybe I had been given the wrong medication. I tried calling and because it was now 9:05 the pharmacy was closed.  So I called the main phone number for the store and was told there was nothing they could do until morning. What the hell!!!!  Who calls someone's home and leaves a vauge message regarding new medication? Are they really that stupid? So now I'm left to sit and wonder if I was given the wrong medications or what?  What am I suppose to think about this?  Should I go to the hospital or just not take any more medication until I speak to the pharmacist in the morning if I wake up????? Idots!!!
*: When checking the status of a refill, the automated voice system stated the pharmacy wanted to talk to me, I stayed on the line, stating my situation regarding a dose change and need for M.D. approval, saying that the M.D.'s office ALSO told me to contact the pharmacy, when HE SCREAMED AT ME "WHAT FOR?"  I was so stunned, I was speechless.  I believe this is a pharmacist that I have dealt with in the past who is always rude and surly.  I do no know this for sure.  He sighed heavily and said "WELL, we faxed the doctor so we just have to wait for a response".  I was not given the chance to reply, the phone went dead.  This is completely unacceptable.  It happened at 0930 on 11/20/09.  
*: Many different things.. 1. mother called doctor who called in meds for her.. went to pick up next day.. not here.. Mom called the next 6 days and even called and complained to doctor.. he said he called them in that day.. in the end.. the date on the meds was 6 days earlier than mom had got them.. good thing they weren't life threatening.. The latest.. and this one is a major thing not to happen.. my mother had a pain med script given to her.. 30 times 5 refills.. first when she ask why the script has been rewritten she is treated like a drug addict in as much that she broke down.. The dosage she is given is 15 pills times 3 refills.. and told she would have to pay for the other 15.. mom calls the insurance agency when tells her for the pharmacy to call them.. and that she should get 30 pills every 28 days without paying.. when she calls the pharmacy and informs them of this.. and has a long discussion, come to find out she is talking with some kid who doesn't have anything to do with the filling of the prescriptions.. and this is just 2 incidences. There are so many similar stories.. why hasn't there been/isn't there a class action settlement?.. I also know of several people around here who have been shorted medicine.. This just happens way too many times, all over the US for it to be a local problem, or someone trying to scalp drugs or just lie about the problem. 
*: The Pharmacy said it would be over 2 hours for our scripts, because all 4 employees had to go to lunch at the same time and close the pharmacy for 1/2 hour.

*: My Walmart pharmacy has changed their generic ** to another provider - at least the pills are different. Most importantly, they don't work. They do not help to get to sleep, nor do they help keep me asleep. Please check with your lab to make sure they are indeed using the right drug to call them generic **.
*: I have been to this store 3 days in a row to pick up a prescription to no avail. Spent at least 20 min. in line each day. I was told that they were busy the first day and I would have to come back again the next  day which I did, the next day I was told to come back again. the 3rd day I went back to be told that the prescription  was out of stock and would not be in until next tuesday
*: I was hospitalized from the 11th of Oct.-the 27th of Oct. for heart problems. The morning I was released I was asked what pharmacy I used I replied, Wal-Mart. Two of my prescriptions were then called into Wal-Mart.The nurse then wrote me out 5 more prescriptions to have filled later in the day.When I got home I called Badger-Care to make sure all my scripts were covered and was assured they were.I then sent my son to Wal-Mart to pick up the two that had been phoned in.My son was told Iwould have to pay full price because I physically did not have an insurance card. I was told by the insurance company that I could give the pharmacy my social cecurity number and they could run the insurance that way. They refused to do that way and insisted I pay cash. I also spoke to someone in the pharmacy by phone, I didnt get her name, But she was also very unhelpful, to the point of being rude, even obnoxious. I then took my remaining five prescrpitions to Walgreens where they were more than happy to run my insuranace through with my social security number with no problem. Today is the second of november and just today I am getting the prescriptions that were prescibed on the 27th of october. Filled by the walgreens pharmacy and only because the doctor called them in again. So my question is how can such irresponsibility go on, snd such rudeness from a company I had trusted and relied on for years. I am very upset with the way I was treated, and the lack of care and respect I was given. 
*: incident 1. mother had called Dr. to refill meds for sinus/ear infection.. called pharmacy which told her meds were not called in.. called pharm today and found out meds have been there all last week.

*: Complaint about Walmart Harrisburg Pa. 

*: HAD YEARLY PHYSICAL WITH MY PCP ON JULY 24,2009.  AT THAT TIME HE WROTE PERSCRIPTIONS FOR ALL OF MY MEDS, FOR 90 DAY REFILLS FOR A TOTAL OF 1 YEAR.  I DELIVERED THE PERSCRIPTIONS TO WAL- MART PHARMACIES IN PLAISTOW ON JULY 27,2009.

*: I left my precription on two different times they were going to have transferred from another pharmacy, that were lost and never done. When ask about it stated they never had it. Well I have to now get my doctor to write another scrip. that cost me time and two trips dropping off & going back to attempt to pick up. The employees don't seem to want to go to any trouble and just throw them away, and claim they never got them, which is a lie. 
*: My complaint is with the pharmacy department. They are having trouble keeping help in this department including the pharmacists. They have been borrowing other pharmacists to work in the Spring Mills Walmart. They have been using help to run the cash registers from the vision center. I don't know the store policy of where the employees can work at. Although I beleive there are different codes that are need to be known to work in different departments. They have had cashiers that said the whole time they were waiting on customers...I don't know what I am doing. Needless to say those days that they waited on me I double checked my prescriptions. I have been told twice that my prescription will be ready at a certain time. I have been allowing more time because they are short handed. But come on...prescription is to be ready at 11 am and I got there at 3 and it still ain't ready. Please. I went to the Spring Mills Walmart because it is closer to me and I live on a limited income. I do have insurance. So I don't go there because of the 4 dollar prescriptions. Don't get me wrong it is great that they feature this for the public. It is a big help to the public. I was told on October 16th they had hired more cashiers for the pharmacy. What about hiring pharmacist for the Spring Mills Walmart? The ones they are borrowing act like it is killing them to fill the prescriptions. They slam the little blue baskets that the scripts are put into.....toss filled prescriptions up on the shelf when they are filled. If they land on the shelf find...if not oh well. I am seriously thinging of changing pharmacy. They have a drive thru and don't use it because they don't have enough people to work the drive thru. This looks like this is extra expense on walmart. Why? I believe that money could of been used elsewhere in the walmart. Like for instance watching the nuts drive thru the crosswalk and not paying attention to the people in it. If you get out of the way so be it. I personally have an instance with this problem. I told one driver off and they stopped the vehicle like they were going to make something of it but when they seen I wasn't alone they drove off. Best thing. Please look into this situation. Thanks. Please reply.
*: I am here in Fla for 2 months. I am 65 years old and use a cane?  I had my Blood pressure medication new RX in Georgia to be sent to a walmart in Fla. I went to a walmart store that I called before and I am new in the area and had a hard time finding the store but I got their at 6:!5pm.  I went to the window and the lady after looking at my AARP 2 insurance cards that I have and my name etc.  told me that I would have to go to another store to get this filled as she fills 800RX;s each day and she was to BUSY now to do this ??? now It took me 45 min to find the store as the area I am in in highway and very busy traffic I am handicap and use a can the the driving cart in walmart?  I just left and went to the dog food isle and cried?  When I got it together I called the walmart in Cedartown Georgia store #727 and talked to the pharmacist and he said all they needed to do mrs Collins is too call me and I will either fax the RX over to them or talk to the phamacist?  but they would not do this they gave me another walmart on Coachman Road? and told me how to go.. I left and it was dark out and never found the place and got home completely stressed..with no BP medication and no Coumadin that I need to take each day and I had been out 2 days? To make a long story short I went with a neighbor here who I asked to take me to a walmart which was the suppercenter store #1390 AND recieved my medication today finally. This was only after 3 walmarts.  I am a perfessional person a retired RN and felt that the first lady at the first walmart was rude telling me if they had to do this it would be Tuesday by the time I could get my medication and she knew I was out of it? also what got me upset to cry was the fact that she looked at me and said "WE FILL 88 PRESCRIPTIONS A DAY AND DO NOT HAVE  TIME TO FOOL WITH THIS"???  Don't you feel this is rude I do and wanted you to know since in Centre Ala at home I drive 18 miles toshope their all the time and I take 6 medications a day and feel at this point I never want to go in the store again?
*: I had refills on my medications and I used Wal-Marts Prescription Refill Service telephone system to order refills early Friday Oct 2nd.  This refill system requires me to supply a telephone number where I can be reached should the pharmacy have any issues, which I provided.  I was given a promise time of noon Saturday to pick up my meds. I always give this pharmacy a full 24 additional hours over what I am promised --just to avoid any unpleasant surprises.  On Sunday Oct. 4th I arrived at the pharmacy only to be told that my prescriptions were not ready because my insurance had cancelled me and I needed to provide a new card.  As I have not been notified by my insurance company of any changes I asked them to double check -- mistakes do happen, expecially with the calibre of the help wal-mart employs.  The pharmacist, Ms. Trang stepped in at that time and stated "we already called once, you are cancelled." I again stated this could not be the case. Ms Trang rolled her eyes and said "you have your card?"  When I gave it to her Ms. Trang asked me "is this your new card?"  I stated that it was the newest one I have been provided with.  Ms Trang then stated that as my insurance carrier has changed I needed to present my new cards before she can process my refills.  At this point I'm beginning to get confused so I asked for clarification, did whomever she spoke with state that my insurance was cancelled or die they state I had a different provider?  Also, if they knew they couldn't fill the rx--which I did not believe--why did no one call me to let me know that?  Ms. Trang replied that it is against Wal-Mart policy to call every time a patient has insurance issues. Really, then why does the refill service require a contact telephone number?  Ms Trang kept repeating that contacting a patient would be against Wal-Mart policy, then added "There is nothing that I can do for you, what do you want me to say?"

*: i went to the pharmasy drop off my son's

*: I used Wal-Marts automated phone service to order some prescription refills early Friday October 2nd 2009. The recording asked for the prescription numbers wich I entered and then I was asked to verify my telephone number where I could be contacted by the store in case of any problems.  The system accepted my request and gave a pick-up time of noon Saturday.  Due to past experiences with Wal-Mart and thier promise times, I always give an additional 24 hours leeway to avoid any unpleasant surprises.  I arrived to pick up my meds on Sunday October 4th around 12:15 pm to be told that there was an issue with my insurance and the prescriptions had not been filled.  I handed my new insurance card to the pharmacist, Trang, who then informed that my insurance was cancelled.  Since I knew this was not the case, I explained why that was not possible and Trang made a phone call then came back and said "your insurance has not been cancelled, but the provider has been changed, we need your new card to fill these meds."  We talked about the insurance and I explained again, the card she was holding IS the newest card I have received, I have no knowledge of any switch and quite frankly, don't believe it.  Trang stated "well it has and we can't do anything for you".  At this time I asked why, if they felt unable to fill my prescriptions -which had legal refills available- why they did not bother to call me with this information on Friday, when the insurance offices were open and we could have gotten this mess cleared up.  Trang responded that it was against Wal-Mart policy to call every time a prescription cannot be filled.  I tried to explain my confusion as to why that would be against Wal-Mart policy when the automated prescription refill service insists that I verify a valid telephone number before accepting any refill requests --specifically so that the pharmacy has a way to reach me in case of difficulties filling the prescription.  Trang responsed that "she didn't know what I wanted her to say".  Well how about "I'm sorry we inconvenienced you?  How about I can sell you a 3-5 day supply of your meds while you get your insurance straightend out, or would you like to pay for your meds and then submit the bill to your insurance for reimbursment?Or, I'm sorry we wasted your time by not contacting you to let you know your insurance company will not authorize payment?  If I had been contacted Friday or even Saturday, I could have contacted the insurance company myself and found out what the issue was, now it is Sunday, the insurance offices are closed and I'm out of my meds."  Trang responded to that by stating " Well I did say I was sorry, but I didn't we needed to call you because I didn't know your insurance company would be closed on Sunday but there is nothing I can do for you." 

*: I went to get my sick child tamiflu and was told that it had to have prior approval that would take 1-3 business days to get. I have to have this med. to my child within the first 48 hours of symptoms. The pharmacy says it caremark's fault, caremark blames the pharmacy. I really don't care. I know that I will bring suite against both companines if my child becomes hospitalized from H1N1 due to this problem. I am so tired of the out to make a buck mentality of your company! The only comfort that I can take is in the promise that what you put forth into the world will come back to you 100 fold. ENJOY!!
*: My 86 yr. old mother-in-law bought what she thought was Tylenol P.M. 24 count.  The box contained an expiration date of 4/11.  When she opened the box, the contents inside was a bottle of regular Extra Strength Tylenol (not P.M.), and the expiration on the bottle in the box said 10/01.

*: I went to order my husband's medicine, told it would be about 40 minutes. Fine, I had no problem with that! Had other shopping to to do. I went back to pick the med's up. Had to stand in line for 20 minutes. When I got to the counter, only 4 of the 5 med's were filled. When I ask about the other medicine,was told it wasn't summited. I ask how long would it take? I was informed it would be aleast another 30 minutes. I told Leslie that I had already waited for over a hour. She said well come back the next day. I tried to explain that I lived about 25 miles away,that I work one full time job,and one part-time job a day, plus my husband is disable, plus he need his med's! She wasn't any help! I went to see the general manger. She called the pharmacy, wanted to know why I couldn't get the med's instead of waiting another 30 or so minutes, afer about 5 mintues the manger said they had the medicine ready, not stand in the long line to go to the counter and pick it up! The lady Leslie was very rude! Told me I should have called it in 24 hours in advance. I told her my husband was disable and told me when when he took hos last pill! When I paid for his last medicine I was also handed a paper with the folloeing" Please call all refill orders at least 24 hours and preferable 3 days in advance to help us provide better pharmacy service to you and and others needing urgent medications." My husband is a dietibic, heart person! Does anyone needs their medicine more than that!
*: I was buying my prescription at this Wal-Mart and last month my amount was $38.00. This month it went up to $160.00. How can the same drug (** 100 mg, 60 tablets) increase that much in a month? My husband and I are on a fixed income and can't afford that kind of increase. I told them at Wal-Mart that I will get my medication elsewhere. The economic impact is that now I will have to pay 4 times more for one of my pills. I guess now every one of my prescriptions will all go up. 
*: Today is the 3rd business day (not including Saturday and Sunday) that I have tried to get a pharmacy issue resolved. I am very displeased with the tone of voice and the amount of inconsistent information. After I thought the issue was resolved, I called to double check and the pharmacy informed me that they had to order the medicine. So, now it will be two more days. This is medicine for my pet (taking heart medication and a diuretic). He is old and does not do well without it. I decided to transfer my prescriptions back to the original pharmacy. I will pay more, but I will get better service.
*: I went to the Walmart Pharmacy to get prescriptions. I had a question about my prescription. In talking with the pharmacist by the name of Richard, he became very rude and finally told me he did not have time for "stuff" like this and threw my medicine and sack contents down and left. He has been rude before when asking questions about a medicine. As far as I am concerned, I will be changing mine and my families' prescriptions elsewhere, if I have to deal with this so-called professional. He needs to have no contact with the public if he is going to conduct himself in this manner.
*: I don't understand why it takes anywhere from one to two hours to get a prescription filled. It doesn't take that long any place else. The prices are cheaper but I think I will start going someplace else.
*: I love the pharmacy. They are very good to me. When I go in, everything is on time. However, I do have a problem with how my prescriptions are being packaged. I asked the pharmacist how I could get them packaged different and he told me this is how my medication comes now. For some reason, Walmart has the medications coming in a new blue plastic container. You have to squeeze with one hand and pull out the meds with the other. This may seem like a good idea but people with fibromyalgia find it very hard to get to your meds. 
*: My wife is taking ** for her Leukemia chemotherapy. The pills were 20 short, so she missed the last 2 days of chemotherapy (15 days). I called the pharmacy and I was told that they were right and I was wrong and there was no effort to give us the 20 pills short. They told me that they had to contact the insurance company, but today is Tuesday, August 18, 2009 and we are being contacted. My wife missed Sunday, August 16, 2009 and Monday August 17, 2009. I called the pharmacy Saturday night August 15, 2009 but the pharmacy was closed. On Sunday morning at 10 AM, I did call the pharmacy. These pills are chemotherapy and we don't know what the doctor will say tomorrow, Wednesday August 19, 2009, when my wife will see him. Thank you!
*: Last evening, 8/21/09, I went to a local Wal-Mart Pharmacy to pick up some meds and do some shopping. A new pharmacist was on duty whom I had never seen before (Tom). The staff and other pharmacists have seen me for years and are familiar with my face. I asked for Equate brand ** for my husband. The tech asked for my ID, which I gave her. Then, the pharmacist came over and started questioning me about why my husband wanted this particular medication. I told him he had seasonal allergies and we both have occasional sinus headaches, and this always works. He told me we needed an antihistamine and should be buying ** instead. I told him we already tried ** samples from the doctor; it made us both too sleepy, and with our work, we cannot afford to be sleepy. 
*: Well, I went to the doctor and he gave me a blood pressure medicine. He told me it would only be $5 or $6 at Walmart. I have never been to a Walmart pharmacy before as I have been getting my medicines at a local pharmacy in Devine. So I asked my sister if she would drop off my prescription at Walmart and she did. I planned on picking them up later. Well, I didn't know she was going to pick them up and the blood pressure pills were $4, but my other script was for $105. I have been on them for 5 years and they only cost $30 every time. So I took them back and they said that since it already left the store, they wouldn't take them back - so I am stuck with it. This ended up costing me a whole day's work three times as much if I would have went to my regular pharmacy. Plus, they are also very rude.
*: Brand name vs Generic at Walmart Pharmacy - After picking up my medications at a CVS Pharmacy, I decided to go to a Walmart Pharmacy just to see if I could save some money by transferring my prescription to Walmart for the upcoming refill (Sept 2009). The reason for my inquiry was the following: Although I have insurance, CVS had charged me $81.00 for a 30-day supply of ** 40mg capsules and being in need of the medication, I was basically forced to pay the $81.00. When the pharmacy clerk at Walmart checked her computer for the pricing of **, I was surprised to hear that the brand name of ** was $124.00 and the generic brand was $177.00. Shouldn't it be the reverse? Please advise. Thank you.
*: Anytime I give a prescription or call in a prescription, it is never filled on time. Consequences: miss days of my medication.
*: On 8/10/09, my wife and I were traveling I-40 when I was getting very sick with a Crohn's attack. We called the doctor in our home town and he called in a prescription to Walmart pharmacy. They told us we cold pick it up in Gallup, New Mexico. We called and asked for the generic. On our arrival, we were shocked to find that they only had the non-generic and it was $500 after my insurance. This is not right and I would like to be compensated for the difference between the generic and non-generic.
*: First, I had dropped off a prescription on 8/5/09 and told them I would be in the following afternoon to pick them up, 8/6/09. I called earlier in the day, 8/6/09, and they did not have any of the medication. She did say they had one and since I needed two of them, I could pick up one pill on 8/6/09 and the other pill on 8/7/09 as they would have shipment in. Once I sent my dad to pick up the pill, they said they would not separate the pills after they told me they would over the phone. He had to make them give me my prescription back since they did not give me the option for them to call them in to another Wal-Mart. 
*: On Tuesday, August 11, 2009, I visited Walmart at the above address to have a prescription filled. Having had my prescriptions filled at all times at another location, I am very much aware of the opening and closing time (i.e., 9 am to 9 pm). I got to the drop-off counter at exactly 8:20 pm. No one else was at that counter at the time. I waited for approximately ten minutes before the pharmacist came to see me. This I had no problem with because there were other customers at another window that she was tending to. On her approach she asked me if I was dropping off a prescription. I said I would like to get my prescription filled. Her remarks were, "I am sorry, sir, but you will have to come back tomorrow.” My reply was, "Ma’am, your sign says you are open from 9 am to 9 pm,” to which she replied, "I am sorry, we close in twenty minutes." I begged her just to fill one of the prescriptions, **, which I take along with ** for high blood pressure. I would come back the next day for the ** as I still had a few at home. She refused and walked away. 
*: Walmart pharmacist screamed at diabetic customer. I have been shopping and having prescriptions filled at the Walmart in Leeds, Alabama for over 7 years and never had any major issues until last week. I have been a regular shopper of Walmart for years, but this location is just 2 miles from my home. First, a clerk in the pharmacy refused to wait on me. When I complained to the pharmacist about this, the clerk began to argue with me - in the presence of the pharmacist. I complained to the pharmacist insisting something should be done to address her poor customer service skills. I also followed up with the manager of the store (who coincidentally was the manager over the pharmacy). 
*: Although Walmart pharmacy may tell you the law prohibits them from giving you any money back for syringes, test strips, damaged prescriptions, etc., if they are damaged, they can give you a gift card for the item even if they don't take it back. If the customer service person doesn't help you and the pharmacy doesn't help, you call 1-800-WALMART from their payphone at the store. Follow what that person tells you to do. Go back to the area they tell you to go to and let them know what they said. If they refuse to follow the directions they gave, you go back and call 1-800-WALMART again and tell them they are refusing to help you and you had just called a few minutes before and you would like them to call a manager at the store while you hold. Beat the idiots at the service desk at their own game.
*: I was given the wrong the medication. There wasn't all of the information in the bag. I took the medication for two weeks for a nail fungus. I had two other meds for seven days. I wondered why I had one med for 30 days. I had to go back to the doctor after two weeks the finger wasn't getting much better. My blood pressure was high so the doctor gave me a written prescriptions and there was a mix up and I did not know it and took medication for the wrong thing. I took the medication to my doctor and that's when we found the mix up after two weeks. My doctor is very sure he did not prescribe that medication to me because he keeps a copy of every paper he gives out. I took the medication back to Wal-Mart and the lady said that my medication name was close to the name of the medication I was given. I should have seen the leaflet in the bag but all the information was not in the bag. I had several medications in the bag. She gave the medication I needed at no cost. I wasn't refunded for what I had bought. My meds were supposed to be for my blood pressure and I was given meds for seizures.
*: We went to the pharmacy to pick up a prescription that they had called and said was ready to pick up. It was about 6:55 p.m. They close at 7:00 p.m. They couldn't find the prescription, because my name was misspelled. When it came 7:00 p.m., we were still standing there and they were looking for my prescription. I had some things on the counter to pay for, and they closed the window in my face and said they were closing because they wanted to go home. They closed the window in my face while I was standing there with product to pay for. It was the pharmacist on duty and 3 lady workers. They didn't want to look for my prescription, because it was time for them to go home.
*: I had 5 refills on a moderate pain medication. I'd been refilling it about every four to five days. When I tried to refill the last refill on the Rx, the pharmacist said it shouldn't have been filled except for every 6 days or so and that based on the original fill date, I'd have to wait 2 weeks for the last refill since it shouldn't have been filled before when it had been. She also wouldn't return the Rx bottle. (I usually refill by phone but lightning took out our phone for several days.) My belief is that the pharmacy is responsible for refilling prior to next fill date and the pharmacist had no right to use the 1st fill date to determine the last fill date. They made the mistake, not me. And the last fill date should be based on the previous last fill date, not the first. And she hasn't any right not to return the bottle since if I'd filled by phone, they wouldn't even have had the bottle even if they didn't fill it.
*: This pharmacy needs to be looked into. I have experienced several unacceptable incidents at this pharmacy. I am a diabetic that has recently been put on insulin. My first bad experience was when I was given the wrong size of syringe. My prescription specifically stated the size. I went home and tried to use the syringe the pharmacist gave me. It was too long and really hurt. I called my doctor to tell him, he asked what size was on the box, I told him and he said that was incorrect, that he had prescribed a smaller size. I went back to Walmart to tell them. At first, they argued that was what I asked for. I told them to pull the prescription and sure enough, they had given me the wrong size. Only thing I got was a "sorry". The next incident was a mix-up in the labels on my medication.
*: It was a Monday about noon. I was obviously daydreaming, or something, when out of nowhere, my 8-month-old pup (70 pounds) decided to jump across my lap in a mad dash after his favorite squeak toy! At the same moment, I decided to get up; and we had the most painful collision! It sounded like a car wreck to me! I never even seen it coming. The top of the dog's head hit me square in the mouth, breaking two of my teeth, ouch! They broke at the gum line and caused the roots to hit my jaw bone. It was torturous. 
*: I ordered an RX by calling, no more refills. I had a new RX at home, brought it in to be filled. Apparently, Walmart called the doctor and got a new RX for the original call. Went on 7/1/09 to pick up the RX's and both were filled. I told the girl that I did not want both RX's as they were the same and took one on that date. I told her to cancel the other. My husband went to pick up another script, 7/8/09 and was given the RX that I cancelled on 7/1/09. He was not told what was in the bag but was just told the total to pay. I went back to the pharmacy this morning and they would not understand what I was saying and refused to accept any of the responsibility for their error. 
*: I went to the pharmacy on July 6, 2009 to fill two prescriptions. I have something called degenerative disc disease and was prescribed a pain killer and a steroid. I have been using this pharmacy for years and the new girl behind the counter wanted to give me a hard time about filling my pain killer. She told me that since I didn't have a state picture ID card that all my other legal documentation meant nothing. So I told her that if she wasn't going to fill my prescriptions, then to give them back to me. She told me that since I didn't have legal ID that she could not give me back my prescription for my pain killer. I had to argue with her for about ten minutes about getting it back. She only returned my prescription after I threatened to call the police.
*: My most recent experience at Wal-Mart was completely unacceptable! I was picking up my prescription and had a question about taking the medication as I had never taken it before. Assuming that's his job, and I know it is, he was very hesitant to give me a consultation. He came to me only after he had spoken to another pharmacist in another language (Asian). They both laughed and stared at me till one of them finally approached me with an attitude. He told me he was very busy and that ** was like taking **. He said to just "pop one in my mouth and drink water." It made me feel very stupid, as I knew he was being a "smart ass." I don't work in the medical field, and I'm a very healthy person. Yet, I know that's not the way to speak to a patient. I asked another staff for his name, and they didn't hesitate to give it to me.
*: Avoid Wal-mart Pharmacy Home Delivery service. For the second time in three months, I don't have my prescription medication because they screwed up. I refilled the prescription with the automated phone service and indicated that I wanted it expedited. The meds didn't arrive on time so I called customer service. Three times I was put on hold for long periods of time. When I finally reached people, I was treated with indifference and contempt, so I don't have medication which I'm supposed to take daily. This isn't a t-shirt, it is my health! But there is no one to call, you can't get help. No one at Wal-mart cares in the slightest if you get meds on time or not.
*: My daughter dropped off three prescriptions this evening to get filled. When she went to pick them up, she was told the total for the three and she did not have enough money to pick them all up right then. (Actually, she had just enough money but she would not have been able to get her children anything to eat if she had paid for all three.) So she told the lady that she would take the antibiotic as she needed it badly and the other two were eye drops and nose spray and she knew she could get by without those until Friday when she got paid but she really needed the antibiotic.
*: On Thursday, 6-18-2009, I had a medical emergency that required an immediate endoscopy procedure resulting in the finding of a bleeding ulcer. My doctor gave me a prescription (which I have since I learned he should not have done because as it turns out it's available over the counter).
*: I was asked for corrections in prescription. Next, I was refused dispensing, instead I was asked for a new prescription. I decided not to do business with this pharmacy any more. The pharmacy rep was very rude on the phone. In the store, the counter delays are usual. And I wasted my efforts in the doctor's office (they are very busy), and this has caused unnecessary delay as well.
*: The pharmacist refused to fill a prescription without cause and told me to go somewhere else to get it filled. I asked him why and he refused to answer me. I will never buy another product from their store again. They have the worst customer service and the pharmacist at this location should be fired.  
*: For the third time in the less than 4 months that I have been getting my prescriptions at the Walmart pharmacy in Dixon IL, I have had a problem with the people behind the counter not being able to find my prescriptions when I come to pick them up. 
*: On 6-6-09, I went to the Walmart pharmacy at Spring Creek and Coit, Plano, TX 75024 (store # 2086) at 12:45 PM. I just moved to this area and wanted to transfer a prescription. Six month ago, the store pharmacies may have changed the laboratory providing ** 25 mg, probably for financial business considerations. Since then it comes in a flat box with the pills sealed in aluminum paper. I am a senior citizen. I have rheumatoid arthritis in my hands and no strength in my fingers in addition to a recent surgery for a broken wrist. I cannot physically remove those pills by pressure with my fingers. In the other pharmacy, where they knew me for over 8 years (and where I got all other medicines), they have made an exception and put the 90 pills in a container.
*: I was victim recently to a 1.5-hour wait on a quoted 45-minute wait. Also, the pharmacist who claimed to be on duty that particular morning emphatically stated that there were no waits over 20 minutes. I take issue with this seemingly bold-faced lie. I sat next to a gentleman that particular day that was initially behind me when I dropped off the prescriptions to be filled. He also had to wait an inordinate amount of time (close to my wait time) for his prescription(s) to be filled. There's more. Fax contact with my doctor’s office on two separate occasions emanating from WM pharmacy never happened according to my doctor’s office personnel. I do not believe in this particular “coincidence”. I will say that prior to several weeks ago, I had basically no problems with this pharmacy. I had been transacting business there for over 5 years easily and received excellent service from all pharmacy personnel.
*: I've used this pharmacy since we moved to Lowell and have had problems with them not having our meds on hand or missing pills, etc., little problems. I recently went to my doctor’s office and he gave me a prescription for ** along with a coupon from Pfizer Pharmaceuticals that states: “Never pay more than $20.00.” I took it with me to the pharmacy with my prescription and handed it all to the technician. She took them and laid them side by side and said that it would take at least an hour and a half. I said that’s a coupon for the **. She said, “I know.” I said okay and went home. I felt terrible as I had a nasty sinus infection. 
*: they have now moved the pharmacy at Walmarts to the BACK of the store on the GROCERY side... isnt the whole reason for a pharmacy to be up front for handicapped and SICK people?????  are they  TRYING to spread deseise throughout the store???  WORST marketing ploy EVER created by walmart, and being handicapped, i will NEVER go into a walmart again,  totally disgraceful~!
*: On 4/10/09 I had an issue with the Wal-Mart pharmacy located in North Little Rock, AR; the situation was as follows:

*: On the 1st of May I requested a refill on a perscribed drug,(aproazolam-1mg ) qty -15 ,When I received the refill , the qty was 5, I did not notice the qty error until 9th as we was out-of-town. This may be just a mistake or sommething else , as zanax is a popular street drug .
*: March 11, 2009 I had a prescription filled at Walgreens. The prescription was for Buderprion this is a generic for Wellbuderion. I am on disabilty and on the prescription plan. I did not pay for the drugs they said that my medicare paided for it. After going home I noticed that walgreens had charged medicare over $1200.00. I called the pharmacy to ask why so much because it was a generic. The tec. told me that it was because no other company had started making it. This took up half of my medicare drug program. Today I am in Georgia and needed some prescriptions filled and the only drug store was Walmart. I  checked on the price of my budeprion for the future. I could not understand when walmart cost was $307.80. The price walgreens charged medicare was highway robbery. This sould be turned over to the SS Medicare office. I also wanted on walgreens prescription for generics and was told that if I was on the medicare drug program I had to pay cash prices.
*: 4/29/09. Just came back from the hospital and went directly to this Walmart pharmacy for my needed medication. I called ahead of time to make sure they accepted Medicaid. The clerk-lady at the drop window even told me and assured me that she receives many prescriptions from my doctor and after taking my Medicaid card and basic information she told me to wait one hour. When it was time to pick up my prescription, the pharmacist said that I had to pay full price because my doctor was not covered by Medicaid, something that must not be true because I was just discharged from the hospital by my doctor's orders and she knows that I lean on Medicaid for my needs. I think it is a lack of commom human sense to give false ilusions to a person who can not afford these expensive but necessary medicines. I was floored and desperate. At this point I was frustated and tired and I needed my medication. I couldn't call my doctor or the Medicaid office to get some inmediate answers because I don't have a cell phone, and the pharmacist didn't even have the courtesy to place the phone call to my doctor. 
*: after 30 minut wait for my medication refil another 15 minut + another 15 minutes and finally no my drugs received.  They told me we are "checking in" and nothing was ready after 2 hours waiting. Sometimes quantity do not much the lebel - usually less tablets than should be, only sealed package is correct. It conclude that personell can not count for more than 28.  They need  math training.  One time I received drugs for another person with the same name, I/m sick and tired with this pharmacy. It is located closest to my home, but with next prescription I will trade convenience for far away location because of service quality there is horrible. Please close this outlet pr replace the staff.  

*: Pharmacy gave me someone elses perscription
*: the pharmancy tech on duty through paper at me when I asked for my script back and nothing was done about it.  I am going to file a discrimination lawsuite  on walmart and I have tried to resolve these issues, but they dont want to try to take care of this problem
*: This concerns my sister. She has been going to the pharmacy for as long as I can remember. My sister has a lot wrong with her. She's in so much pain it's not even funny and, to see her like this, hurts my heart. But my sister needs strong medicines for her pain. Every time she would go get her medicine, it took most of the day. She would have to go home 15 miles and then come back. That we could handle but in March, she tried to get her refills and the pharmacist and the lady who helps got very rude. My sister took her prescription in on Monday. They told her to call back on Tuesday to get the rest. 
*: I ordered my grandmother's medicine 4 days before I picked them up and only 2 of the 3 were ready. Please note they had 4 days to fill. The girl at the register informed me that the medicine needed prior authorization. I told her I knew that and that her doctor had called 4 days ago and got the medicine approved for 1 year. She stated that she was not aware of this. I told her I knew this to be true because I worked for the doctor and had received the confirmation letter of approval. I picked up my cell phone and called my office and asked my office manager if she could fax the pharmacy a copy of the approval letter in my grandmother's chart. 
*: I had changed over to Wal-Mart Pharmacy several months ago. Well, this is the 3rd time they hadn't got my medicine right. They were supposed to give me 2 bottles of a certain medicine, plain on the bottle 1 of 2. Well, I got home and found I only have 1. This happened twice. And finally another situation, I didn't have all the medicine when I got home; for example, I ordered 3 and only got 2 of them. Well, I forget when I get there to check it before I leave. Well, I shouldn't have to. Then it's way across town I have to go back. So I’m changing to another pharmacy. Never will I use Wal-Mart Pharmacy again! My health is not good, and I have to go way across town. Gas is expensive, and I should not have to do this; it should be to where I can trust my pharmacist. Once is okay, but not 3 times.
*: My wife waited 45 minutes for our son's medication due to his illness and when she arrived home, noticed they gave my 7-year-old ** 10 mg and get this, someone else's name. We called them and they wanted us to drive 30 minutes to return the medication and get our son's. Here it is 12:00 a.m. and I told him, "No, we will come in and speak to a manager."
*: He refused to order in the medication and fill my daughter's and my husband's prescription because he has been there a year and only filled this same kind of prescription 4 times. Those were his exact words to me and the doctor's office. Go figure. I asked, “So, I either drive 25 miles to another Wal-Mart and get the script filled or go without our meds?” He replied, “If you want to look at it that way.” This makes me angry. I have informed my healthcare provider that we will no longer use the Wal-Mart Pharmacies. He said they couldn't get meds from the other Wal-Mart Pharmacy to fill it. I am frustrated and disappointed with the lack of service. We will have to pay more and go to another pharmacy that is not familiar with the scripts we have been using.
*: My wife tried to get an Rx refilled, and they said she did not have a refill. Then, they said they found it. They filled it wrong, giving her a 40 mg, which should have been a 10 mg. When called, they said to bring it back to the store. We caught the mistake, but they need to check their work. This is not the first time. If my 83-year-old mother had got this, she would have trusted them to know what they are doing. So as you can see, older people should not shop at Wal-Mart. Thanks for your time.
*: My son was given a higher dosage of his **. Instead of 20mg, he was given 22mg by his psychiatrist. When I went to pick up the medication, I was never explained that they did not have the 22mg and was given only the 2mg. I did notice the color was different but expected that since the dosage was supposed to be higher. My son has schizoaffective disorder. Without the correct dosage of medication, he became violent, attacking my daughter and myself leaving bruises on my arms and neck. He choked my 14-year old daughter and has left her traumatized from this miscalculation in his prescriptions. I found this out when I accessed the online website for Wal-Mart that the rx I had was for 2mg not 22mg. I spoke to one of the technicians over the phone and today, they cannot locate the prescription error online. It was deleted offline but they cannot delete what they billed medicaid for. Since my son is disabled, he receives medicaid.
*: Problem #1: I had a prescription that was misfilled by my doctor. He wrote it for 1x/day; it should have been for 2x/day. Walmart wouldn't talk to the doctor to correct it. I did and it was corrected. However, after 2 refills, Walmart refused to fill my final refill because it was too early to refill at 1x/day. I explained that it was corrected, and I was getting the prescription at 2x/day. They refused to correct the problem. So I switched to Walgreens. They had the problem corrected within the hour.
*: Generic drugs for $10 (for a 90-day supply). What a joke! I had my doctor call in this prescription and guess what? They only had one month's supply on hand. So I asked, “Can I pay for the entire order now and pick up the rest in three days?” “No, we can't do that,” was the reply. “But we can check other stores to see if they have enough on hand.” “That isn't going to work since I only come into town twice per week and I'm on my way back home.” (I live about twenty miles outside of Austin.) “Well, then I can't help you,” was the pharmacist's reply. So, my question is, does Walmart intentionally under-stock generics to avoid the $10 price? Is this some sort of false advertising? I am disgusted.
*: I had turned in a new prescription from my doctor on a Tuesday and waited until Thursday to pick it up in case they needed pre-authorization for it. It was around one o'clock. I went up to the window, and since my whole family gets their medicine at Walmart, I was greeted by name. A search by the trainee turned up nothing so she asked the pharmacist, a young white male with closely cut hair. His response was, in a curt manner, "It's not covered by her insurance. Tell her to call her doctor and get something that is covered." I asked if they had called for a pre-authorization and I was given the same response. I have never been treated this way by this or any other pharmacy ... and if it continues I will find a new one.
*: Your pharmacy at 3501 Cortez Road Close. We tried to have the prescriptions filled at the other Cortez Road store, but they said the prescriptions were not transferred and we had to call the doctor to get the doctor to call the pharmacy. We have never dealt with a pharmacy before that refused to call the doctor for us. Also, since Wal-Mart closed the store and told us to go to the other Cortez Road location, why did they refuse to help us? We talked with a person who did not identify themselves. We think it was a technician.
*: I picked up my prescription for antibiotics (Rx#6742785)on 03/16/2009 and had a second prescription to pick up , but it was not covered by my insurance so I decided to wait on pick up. The pharmacist said she could hold the prescription for me for 7 days. I returned to pick up the prescription 2 days later (03/18/2009) and the pharmacist was in coversation with another employee behind the counter, at which time I was totally ignored. Another lady came from the back area and asked me if I had been helped. My answer was NO. She motioned to the pharmacist that I was waiting and she was brushed off. The lady explained to me that she did not work back there, that she was just putting drugs on the shelves and apologized that she was unable to help me and she left. I don't know how long I stood there, but the this same lady returned after awhile to place more items on the shelf and asked again if I had been helped yet,to which my answer was still NO. I informed her I was just going to leave and have my prescriptions transferred to Kroger. She apologized again, I thanked her for her kindness,and I left. I went to Kroger and they could not transfer the prescription for me because I did not have the proper information. The following day (03/19/2009) I returned to pick up my prescription because I needed it and I had gotten over being upset with this lady pharmacist. The line was considerably long so I had to wait and when I got up to the counter I was informed that the precription had been returned to the shelf. I stated that she had told me on a previous date the the prescription would be held for 7 days before being returned to the shelf. She informed me that was correct so it must have been more than 7 days ago that I was in there. I explained it had only been 3 days and she argued with me at the same time telling me if I wanted to wait she could have it ready for me in about 20 minutes. I did not want to argue with this person any longer, because it is typical to be treated this way at this pharmacy. I came back 20 minutes later, I picked up my prescription (Rx#6742786) and I have now transferred all of my precriptions to Kroger and will not return to this pharmacy. I am in customer service and I would never dream of treating another human being in this manner. I am relieved that I was able to transfer my precriptions and that I no longer have to deal with this treatment. I thank you for your time to read about my complaint. Sincerely, Susan Anderson
*: I had 5 perscriptions filled at your amherst NY store adress to follow. Thinking that it would be cheaper there. WRONG the total of the 5 Perscriptions was $288.00 which is a ton of money for anyone, I wasnt called and informed that it would be that much, or advised that it would. I would have tried elsewhere, last time I fill my metoprolol it was $6.00 so thinking that i would be paying a little more then $30 dollars i left the store after dropping off scripts the Scripts are   RX6819511 = $69.00 , RX6819614=$172.00,Rx6819522=$82.00 one for $10 and one $0 because it was a sample. If I knew it was goiing to be that much at Walmart I would have tried to go else where. I am very disapointed it the way this was handled and I will advise my friends and neighbors of what just happened in the Walmart Pharmacy the address of said store is WAL-MART store east,lp

*: First, I must say that your employees were wonderful!  This has NOTHING to do with them.  These guys (in my opinion) get too many gripes and not enough pats on their back for the hard work they do!

*: After seeing a Dr. on March 28 [saturday] @ 1pm and was diagnosed with a viral infection in my throat. I brought the prescriptions to the walmart pharmacy. After handing in the prescriptions, I was told it will take an hour. I returned in 1 1/2 hours and was told by Pharmacy Tech, David that by prescriptions will NOT be filled. I asked why, and was told in a very harsh manner that my Dr. is unable to be reached. I explained that I was just there and he is expecting the call. David while speaking in a loud harsh voice, loud enough that the whole section heard him say, You don't follow directions, do you? He then went to the Pharmacist on duty and told him in a loud manner that I [pointing to me] don't follow directions, and they both laughed in my direction. The Pharmacist called me over and told me that the Dr. has to be notified before my drug can be filled. I said that the Dr. was waiting for the call and the Pharmacist asked if I wanted to take care of this then. Knowing that I was getting no help at all, I asked for the prescriptions back to go somewhere else. The pharmacist slammed the scripts on the counter saying Thank you and walked away.
*: I went into the store to pick up some presciptions that the doctor had to pre-authorize due to new insurance for the third time. 2 times before going I called and talked to someone directly who told me that the doctor had authorized them to be filled and they were ready. I have to get a ride up there to pick them up. I simply told the tech if they weren't ready I would not be back when this person came up and started raising her voice in front of everyone telling me not to speak to her tech that way. My husband was standing behind me and said I never raised my voice at the tech. This assistant manager needs some customer service training. My blood pressure was extremely high that day and I did not need her trying to get me upset. I had many many presciptions there but they will not be for long. Several people I have talked to in the years I have been going said they have had problems but I continued to go. I hope something will be done about this but others have said they've complained and nothing was done about it.
*: This pharmacy is one busy place with few employees. There is a  telephone system to call for refills. The first thing this system requests is our telephone and area code numbers.Then it goes on requesting the prescription number of the medication to be refilled.Then it gives us a time and date for pick-up   GREAT!
*: The pharmacist at the Super Walmart off Marsh lane blatantly refused to fill my blood pressure prescription because I arrived at the pharmacy at 6:55PM today 3/14/09; five minutes to closing time. I was told by the pharmacist and the techs that the pharmacy was closed. The official closing time is 7PM. I requested to speak with someone and was told the pharmacist was the assistant manager. I am a registered nurse and unlike the pharmacist, the nurse practice act requires me to assist my patients in a way that prevents harm or risk of harm. Refusing to fill a blood pressure medication when I don't have any left come pretty close to harming me. As I write this complaint, I am experiencing a throbbing headache. Reading the previous complaints however, mine complaint pales in comparison. This pharmacist should be held to a higher standard. Walmart as well can change their close time to 6:55PM.
*: Yes my name is Betty Gauci and I have been getting my prescriptions there at this pharamacy for years.  Up until I went to my Orthopedic on the 5th of this month and he told me if I knew of a Melanie, no last name.  I told him no and he perceed to tell me about someone getting this drug in my name.  The first time it went through which was last month and about 2-3 weeks later they tried it again.  That's when the pharamacy called my doctor and brought it to his attention.  This happened before that the person was going to other pharamacys and getting the same drug and using my home phone number and using other people's name; besides mine, also her brothers and others.  But also  and I found out yesterday that the one they caught is the one that did it.  For she admitted to the crime, but she was arrested.  Well, now I have to find another pharamacy, in which I did because of the stupid crap.  And what really got me the female pharamcists, when I talk to her, her tone of voice got really on my nerves, saying get over it lady, you're calling in false presciptions and hung up in my face.  Now that was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Very rude, and I even told her and that Andy I'm not that stupid.  But they can't service me, for they apparently don't believe me.  I told them I've already talked to a lawyer and he wanted to press the issue and I told him right now to put it on hold.  But I told that Andy that woman owes me an apology or I want her but fired.  He said he'd never allow that to kind of talk from one of his employees to happen if he had been there.  I called back and talk to the manager and told him what had happen then patch me through to talk to Andy and I perceed to tell him about it.  I told him that me and my husband spends anywhere from $200.00 to $300.00 a week at Wal-Mart.  But that kind of attitude, they're leaving a very bad taste in our mouth.  My husband didn't appreciate that either from those people, the way they treated me.  So, if something isn't done by those people I will contact my lawyer again and tell him to go ahead.  For they shouldn't be working there if they're going to act that way toward people, for I certainly didn't appreciate that from them.  The other number for Wal-Mart same address: is 251-943-3400, if you care to speak with the manager, I can't remember his name either, for I was so upset that I couldn't think clearly, the only reason I remember Andy's name is because my husband's name is Andy.  Also I have a cell number 251-609-2173.  Our home phone has a recorder where you can leave a message if you can't reach me on the cell or I'm away from my home and I'll call you back..  But I do want something done.  I guess now since Wa-Mart acted the way they did I'll be shopping somewhere else, for they remind me of spoil meat or food.  And I deal with a Federal Workman's Comp and when I called them on this, they said it was Wal-Mart's fault for allowing that to go through without my being there to verify it.  For I have a case number and I told them and Wal-Mart I don't give that information out to noone other than my daughter and husband.  And then Wal-Mart wants to say it was workman's comp's fault for workman's comp pays for my medicine.  To me it's Wal-Marts fault for allowing this to go through without contacting me or my doctor when it happened the first time.  If I did say to use one of your lawyers, who would have to pay them????  But I do have my own.  Wal-Mart to me would have to pay.
*: to make long story short, i had my daughter to dr. for high fever, he discovered an infection, he asked what pharmacy, keep in mind rite ade is accross the street from her dr office. frackville pa. walmart is 6 miles away. i said walmart, stclair what a mistake, dr had faxed the script around 515-530 pm and told us to give them about an hour take your time, so we did this getting to the store at 635 we went for her script and was told there is none, when dad mentioned dr had faxed it around 530 they said you were better off bringing in a paper script, faxed ones get pushed back till the customer comes in then gets put in line to fill, telling dad he had to wait another hour. dad explained she is 10 and has a high fever and we need to start this meds, he in turn was told an hour, we called dr. adukaitis 570-874-2033 which is going to make note for future references for all his patients. here is the best part, i was given a partial script because the pharmacy doesnt have enough, i was told come back in a few days...
*: My Wife and I got sick so we had 3 prescriptions from a local DR we needed filled as soon as possible, I presented them to the prescription drop off window at 1:30 PM on Friday the 6th of March, the person at the counter informed me it would be 3 to 4 hrs before they would be ready, I returned at 5:30 pm, stood in line for 45 min in front of the pickup window, during this time one of the pharmacists walked out in the store, wandered around visiting with friends for at least 10 min. and Douglas spent an equal amount of time on the phone laughing etc. it didn't appear to be in the line of business. When I finally reached the window to be waited on they had to do up one of my prescriptions and the other 2 had not been filled but they said I only turned in one, they had lost the paper work from the DR., after my insisting that I had dropped it all off together they located the other 2, I told Douglas I was going to report this direct to the company, he twice sugested that I talk to the store MGR, while in line other customers commented that is always this way so to comment to the store mgr. would be ludicrous as the store Mgr. would have to know the situation if it is always this way.

*: On more than one occation I have gotten my medications filled at Wal-Mart Pharmacy. My doctor had prescribed me medication for pain because I fell and sprained my ankle and and ended up with a pulmonary embolism in my lung. The er had prescribed me 15, 7.5 Loratabs when I was there and then I am aleady taking Loratab 10's for cronic back pain. My doctor told me to take the scrips to my pharmacy and get them filled, when I went to pick them up I was imformed that they had a hold on my pain medication per Pharmasist Kelly Vaughn. She told me that she was not going to fill the pain meds because I had gotten one filled 2 days before for the 7.5 and she would have to call my doctor I told her to call my doctor he is the one who told me to get my prescription filled. She then made the excuse that she could not reach him. I told her just to give me all of my prescriptions back and I would be moving all of my medications to another pharmacy. This is not the first time this problem has happened out there and the problem is always with the same pharmasist Kelly Vaughn.She has done the same thing to other members of my family and family friends along with some of the medication not being in the bottle for example: if there is a script for 30 you may have 27 in the bottle. I took all of my meds to Walgreens and had no problem getting my medications filled.
*: My mother had her dr.'s office call in her perscription into wal-mart of AZ.  She has always received a 90 day supply @ approx the new rate of $96.

*: I put a formal complaint to wal mart about the treatment I received from another pharmicist at same drug store,mr.white was his supervisor and I assumed he brought it to his attention I thought the case was closed as I continued to do buisness witw the store.today I bring a perscription to be filled and mr.white tells me that the doctor has to use a nacrotic perscription as my perscription was under the act.Which was blatently false.As I got it filled at another pharmacy.I feel they are just trying to get back at me because I filed a complaint to the store's complaint dept on the internet.
*: I am very fimilar with warlmart pharmacy and ALL their "friendly" employees.  On March 5, 2009 I had dropped off a prescription for my sick daughter at 10:00 a.m..  The girl at the drop off window took my script and other information that is necessary.  This is our regular pharmacy.  The customary  usual wait for the precription will take 30 minutes.  My daughter and I, shop for other things and waited at the Dunkin Donuts within the store.  35 minutes later I go pick up the script.  and like EVERY OTHER TIME the script is not ready, they need my insurance card, which is already in the system.  I give it to the women and she tells me I have to wait again. That they did not fill the order. (mean while all the pharmacy employees are snickering) Everytime I go there, I do not know what it is, they do it every time laughing no less. Most are young girls and they let say very "catty". No work ethic at all, and to say the least no customer service at all.  Most of the workers you see smoking infront of the first double doors as your walking in. I had complained to the district manager Dave O. the first time, which was just about 12 weeks ago.  The times before that I have my children father pick up the script, who does not have a card, and never has a problem. Now on this occassion, I ask them why is it everytime I come here, you intentially do this.  The phamarist says lady you have an attitude and why don't you do yourself a favor and take your business somewhere else! Not only was she loud talking across the floor infront of all the employees and other customers and my child.  Unfortunely this is where they take our insurance. First of all everytime I go here these women have treated me with no respect, no customer service and purposely make me wait longer than any other patron.  She has embarrassed me infront of a crowd of people and my daughter.  And when I asked her name, she pulls her name tag almost to her chin and said Darlene!  I said great, can't wait to talk to your manager, she said yeah good luck with that.  Oh Boy!!!!And this women's mixing my childs medication????ARE YOU KIDDING!!!! Does this women have any work ethic? Any standard of care to me?  I'm mean really?  Is she untouchable as she claims? I want to know, because in my mind she is a pharmacist who has a duty of care of reasonable standard.  Two times complainig to the Distict store manager, and store manager and nothing.  So this woman can intentally inflect emotional distress upon me if I continue going to this pharmacy?  Thats great...

*: At 5pm on 3/4/09 I dropped off a prescription for antibiotics for my 93 yr old mother.  I was told it would be a two hour wait.  When I returned they then informed me that they would not be able to fill it until the next day--I asked of the impact of letting a 93 yr old go with an untreated cellulitis for 12 additional hours and the reply from the pharmacist was that they were sorry but that they were really short of help.  No offer to release the rx so I could take it elsewhere.
*: My husband dropped off a script for 5 different meds at 2:00, he was told they would be ready for pick up at 4:00.  I went at 5:00 to pick them up and was told they would not be ready until the following day.  The next morning I was called and asked what kind of prescriptions they were for because they had lost them.  I had to call the doctor to have him call them in.  
*: I went to Walmart Pharmacy for a refill on a prescription sleep medication. The pharmacist said it was not ready, that he needed to speak to my primary care physician first. He later called and said that, after speaking with my physician, the refill had been cancelled.  The pharmacist had apparently looked on the state website and saw that I had previously had an order from a different physician at two different times for this med. He had told my physician that I was using multiple pharmacies and multiple orders. He then called the other prescribing physician, a hospital ER physician, and, instead of speaking to him, ended up somehow telling the hospital CEO and director of nursing about it. 

*: Went to buy advil cold and sinus, asked the lady for it and then she asked me if i wanted jell caps or tablets.  I thought outloud, I think she uses jells. She then said , are you buying this for her?

*: I have been trying to fill a precription since Friday, February 27th. I hadn't used my insurance card during the new year.  This was the first time.  My medication for my high sugar was no longer covered.  They wanted my doctor to call the insurance to get approval. So Monday they called and Tuesday it was approved. I went to the pharmcy on Tuesday afternoon around 4:15.  I was told that it would be another 30 minutes before it was ready. While standing there another family asked for their percription back, so they could go somewhere esle.  Their son had needed his medicine on Monday and they still did not have it. I go do my shopping and come back 40 minutes later.  I am told it will be another 30 to 40 minutes.  I did not have time or energy to wait another 40 minutes.  I have gone without any medication for my dibetic condition since Feb.26th. The people behind the counter move like snails.  The lines are long and only one person will be working the front counter.  The Pharmacist are standing at the computers.  Who is filling the percriptions? We have a new Walgreens coming in and many other pharmacies. I will be looking for a new place to do business.
*: My wife broke her shoulder at school as she carried boxes to the parking lot. The pain prescription was initially honored at the Sulfur Springs Wal-Mart. But since her shoulder had swollen to the size of a watermelon the Doctor said she would need to wait 2 weeks for surgery until the swelling abated. He prescribed more pain medicine but Wal-Mart twice refused to honor the prescription a week later. Now out of pills and in agony we are having to go to the hospital to get pain relief. The pharmacy without conferring with the Doctor has decided what care she should have. 
*: My name is Aeriel C 

*: I went to the walmart pharmacy for a prescription I have no insurance so when I found out how much the script would cost each month I decided to call my dr and see if she could prescribe me something that would cost less; she did and called the new script into the pharmacy.  An hour and a half later I called the pharmacy to see if it was ready and they couldn't find it, they finally found it after I was on hold for 10 minutes and said it would be 45 minutes until it was ready...it should have been filled when the dr called it in, but whatever...so I waited 45 minutes and headed up there I stood in line for 15-20 minutes when i got up to the counter they said it hadn't been entered in their system yet and that it would be 45 minutes until it was ready...I told the woman that I had called at least an hour before and they told me the same thing her response was are you sure you didn't get the machine? unless answering machines can respond back and give you a time frame...NO! I wanted to make sure that I was going to get the right amount so the lady directed me back towards the drop off window there were two ladies standing in the back corner talking about their boyfriends not paying any attention to customers waiting. so I said EXCUSE ME the girls turned around and said WHAT DO YOU WANT? I told them that I was a customer and needed some assistance so she huffed and puffed about it and came to the window...I was so disgusted that I just went to my class and came back the next day when it was actually ready, but I had to stand in line for another 20 minutes...Walmart needs to take a lesson in customer service..just the other day I had a confrontation with a RUDE associate at one of the front registers...something needs to be done, I am seriously considering going somewhere else for both my scripts and groceries because of the disappointing service I have received over and over.
*: 2/22/09

*: I was physically assualted. he ripped my purse from my arm,grabbed the front of my shirt along with my bra exposing my breast's to fellow costomers! He then hit me with such force while putting me in a head lock that it literally took me out of my shoes! once he had me in the head lock he piled drived into the concrete sidewalk laying on top of me while the pharmisist came out of the store and yanked my arm up over my head. All this for a eyeshadow that i never left the store with and offered to pay for. not to mentoin the hygien and groceries i bought and never got. 
*: For the past four months, we have been getting 4 prescriptions filled ( 2 prescriptions from two physicians) each month at the Palmhurst Walmart  in TX.  Because we do not live in Texas, the prescriptions must be transferred or refilled each month.  Every month when we try to pick them up, we are given a different excuse why one or all of them aren't ready and can't be filled.  The doctor(s) hasn't called them in is the most common excuse but when we verify that they have been called or faxed in, the excuse changes to the insurance won't pay for them,  the physician's license expired a year ago ( Walmart had been filling his prescriptions for the year it had supposedly been expired) it's a controlled substance and can't be filled from an out-of-state doctor so we must get a local physician to write the prescription (the medication is the same one Walmarts around the country have been filling writen from the same physician for over a year, the prescriptions were faxed in but it must have been lost or put aside because they were very busy.........

*: we are having a hard time with the pharmacy at walmart. they give us wrong medicine and make 2 or more trips

*: I was charged full price for two prescriptions that are generic and are on the 4.00 list.At least on the online

*: i went to fill a simple script for my one year old child and i picked up his meds all seems to be fine. we get home i give him his meds put him down for a nap. shortly there after i realized the wal mart pharmacy had given me someone elses medications and now i have just given it to my child. after a long evening in the er he ended up fine. wanna talk about a HUGE mistake!  and thats not all i talked to the pharmacist on the way to the er he was so cold and unconcerned! not to mention his advice was the exact opposite of poison controls! this could have seriouly hurt my son. im furious and i will never use wal mart pharmacy again and if i can help it i will not be shopping there either!!!!!!!!!!!
*: My wife was diagnosed with a sinus infection.  She was not able to breath very well and she was 5 months preganant at the time.  After the doctor's appointment she had her perscriptions faxed to Wal-Mart Pharmacy in Lamar Co.  I witnessed the doctor's office fax the perscriptions which was an antibiotic and an inhaler which my wife needed desparatly.  I went in to the Wal-Mart Pharmacy close to closing time which is 10 miles from my house.  They did not have it ready!  I told them I saw the doctors office fax the perscriptions but they said, and I quote everyone says that.  Anyway, I ended up empty handed that night and my wife suffered all night.  I got a call the next morning from the doctor and she said that the pharmacy had lost the perscriptions in a stack of papers!  They had the perscriptions they just did not bother to look for them!
*: Saturday Feb.7,I needed to drop off a prescription and also pick up a prescription the pharmacy was 9 minutes late in opening.So at 7 minutes after I walked over to customer service to see why,after waiting there 3 minutes the lady in customer service told me that they were now open to go back and try again. When I went back and asked what had happened the person told me if she went to a store and did'nt like the way things were she would just go to another store. I really couldn't believe what she said. I told her if she told all of the customers to go  somewhere else she wouldn't have a job. I further told her I lived 13 miles from the store and I didn't want to go somewhere else. She then became a little upset and said to wait and she would fill the prescription right then. So I went from the drop off window to the pick up window to pick up a different prescription, stood in line again for my turn,asked the lady there if I could pick up my prescription and she said, rudely, she is filling it now I pointed out that I had a different prescription waiting to be picked up and she said you can wait, and I'll ring them both up at the same time. I needed to take my medicine I thought I had waited long enough.When I dropped off the first prescription the day before at 9a.m. and asked how long it would be because I lived out of town the man told me I don't care where you live it is going to be after 2:30 this after noon. I pass a Walgreen's which is 9 miles from where I live and I can take the first ladys advice and take my business there.Saturday I walked up to the pharmacy at 8:55[first one there] and left at 9:38. 
*: The pharmacy is understaffed and they have people working in there that are not qualified to run a business.  They had 5-6 people in line out of the people that were there to get prescription 5 had problems and had to wait unusually long times to get it fixed.  Two people behind the counter filling presciptions and one person out front to wait on everyone and deal with the computer problems insurance problems and doctors offices not calling.  It is not like this in the evening hours it is like that any time I go there.  If you are filling that many scripts then you need more people.

*: Perscription was dropped off Saturday morning. I was told it would be ready after 3pm that day.  It wasn't ready until the following Wednesday, and yes I did go there everyday to pick it up.  Then they shorted me two packets from the order.  As I was standing there waiting everybody's name birthdays, perscriptions being picked up were just shouted out with no regards to privacy. Someone really needs to take a look as to how the pharmacy is run there.  I saw several HIPPA violations just standing there.  The people are rude, scarastic, and loud.  As I was waiting form them to fill the perscription, after calling this time to make sure it was there, I could hear them behind the drug counter talking about me and the medication that I was waiting for.  I will never be back there to get any perscriptions filled.  There are enough Walgreens & CVS pharmacies in the area.  

*: Had 3 prescriptions filled on 1/30/09.

*: Went to direct care and had a prescription called in. I was so sick it was so hard to even stand, but I knew I had to get this medicine. 

*: I dropped off a script to be filled and returned the next day (they told me about 4 hours).  They did not fill it because they 'didn't know how I would be paying for it'.  My doctor faxed in a script...they will not have it ready for 2 more days because they have to order it from another location.  This script is for a chronic condition, we will need this every month. I asked the pharmacist if she would keep this in stock and she said no, they have to order it every time.  I understand they don't want to keep some drugs in stock but to not stock drugs that are going to be used on a regular basis by a customer is just a bit off.  They keep telling me I can take the script someplace else...the next closest pharmacy is 7 miles away...do they want my business or not?
*: Lost my pills and have only 1 left. We are expecting a debilitating ice storm later this afternoon and asked if I could pick up my prescription before 1:00. ( I called it in @9 a.m.) They said it usually takes them24-48 hours to fill a prescription???????Go figure?????  But they (I guess out of the goodness of their heart would have it ready by 6pm since I was persistent.  I asked if I could just pick up about 4 pills now before the ice hit.  I am over fifty and did not want to hit the roads after the ice hits. She said I could possibly pick up one only. I asked to speak to the pharmacist to see if I could get more and she did not even five me the courtesy of an answer...just put me on hold for about 10 minutes.  I continued to hold. I am sure the young girl had spoken to the pharmacist...because I have picked up several pills in the past when needed. He also said I could only get one pill. I THINK WALMART PHARMACY HAS THE 'WORST' CUNSOMER SERVICE' IN THE WORLD!!!!!! I WILL BE TAKING MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE AND I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME!!!! 
*: I had called in a regular prescription that I utilize.  On December 29, 2008, I went to pick up the medication at the drive thru window.  I had extended family members and my children with me.  The pharmacist came to the window and asked me if I had any questions in regards to taking the medications.  I stated that I did not; however, he proceeded to disclose the names of the medications and questioned me as to why I was taking them.  I was hesitant to respond but finally just answered that the medications were for anxiety.  He continued stating that the medications were sedatives and that he was unsure of why I would be taking both medications.

*: I called on Friday evening to have my prescription renewed and the automated service told me it would be ready by 11am on Sunday.  I got to the pharmacy around 12:40pm and had to wait of course but that was fine.  I get up there and my prescription isn't ready because there is a note in my file saying I need to talk to the pharmacist.  Exasperated, because I went over this the last time, I tell the lady its because my insurance doesn't cover birth control pills but I pay cash so it doesn't matter.  She comes back and tells me that the pharmacist told her the problem is with the computer system because it automatically puts it through the insurance before filling the prescription.  Having worked in a pharmacy I know this is a bunch of BS and tell her so.  The pharmacist over-heard me and from a good 20ft away began yelling at me!  Yes, he literally yelled at me while he sat hsi butt on a stool in front of a computer.  He didn't even have the decency or courage to come and talk to me directly just yelled at me across the pharmacy.  He told me that he didn't know what my problem was even though I had explained what my problem was.  If there is an issue with a prescription, call the individual because more than likely the problem can be resolved that way but his response was that he deals with over 100 problems a day and can not be bothered to be calling people.  I was shocked by the lack of customer service and down-right rudeness of this man.  By this time I am beyond exasperated and onto fuming.  My husband was trying to keep my calm when the pharmacist again began yelling at me.  Telling me that if I'm going to treat him like this I am not welcome to refill my prescriptions there.  I said that was fine because there are plenty of other pharmacies that would love to have my business.  His reponse was that he would make certain that I was never allowed to get another prescription filled again.  Finally my prescription is ready I go to pay but can't because he won't close out the prescription.  He again starts yelling at me while the technician is trying to get out of there that I am never to show my face there again to which I say that I will be reporting him to corporate and his parting words were to make sure I spelled his name correctly.  I told him its not difficult to spell Bill.  Later when I got home and opened my prescription, he didn't my the right supply and opened my birth control pills.  I was hesitant to report him but will continue to do so now that he tampered with my medication.  He obviously didn't take his meds because his rude, ignorant, beligerent and unprofessional manner was appalling.
*: On 09/17/08, a prescription Metrogel 1% Kit was filled for me for treatment of Rosacea.  At the time there was a prescription for Finacea (azelaic acid) Gel, 15%, also for the Rosacea.  I had used the sample for Finacea before asking to get the prescriptions filled.  The Finacea burned my face, and the doctor said not to use it; therefore, I related to the pharmacists help that I couldn't use this and to please take off list of prescriptions.  

*: After I called in perscriptions abd told when they would be ready...they were not.  I am disabled and have to beg persons to go to the drug counter. They end up getting disgusted with me  and to wait throws my monthly insurance company off.  At the very least...Call if late or call if missing

*: When I phoned in my refills on January 12, 2009, I was told my prescriptions would be ready in 2 days.  I gave them 3 days just to be sure.  When I got there to pick up my prescriptions, I was told they were out of stock on the generic blood pressure medication that I take.  They told me to come back in a couple of days and they would be happy to fill it then.  Again, I waited 3 days to give them enough time to get it in and fill my prescription.  When I went in, I was told it still hadn't come in.  I asked if they could give me a substitute since I had been without my prescription now for several days.  Their answer was: We can't give you a prescription that your doctor hasn't prescribed!  I knew that there was a brand name equivalent to this medication because that was what I used to take before they came out with a generic.  (Why is it that pharmacies can substitute a generic for a brand name, but can't substitute a brand name for a generic when they are out of stock?)  I was told that my medication would be in within 2 days.  Finally, 9 days after I originally phoned in my refills I, again, returned to Walmart.  THEY DIDN'T HAVE A RECORD OF ME PHONING IN MY REFILL!!!!  I was referred to the drop off counter.  There I was told that my prescription had been returned to the shelf because it had been 9 days since I had phoned it in!  I tried to explain what the problem had been and after she verified this information with someone more qualified than I, she informed me that it would be another 20 minutes or more before my prescription would be ready.  I had already been in the store for an hour just during this visit alone.  When I asked if waiting a week and a half wasn't long enough, she tritely informed me that their pharmacy operated on a first-come, first-served basis.  I went back to the back of the line and awaited my turn.
*: I thought that I would give Walmart a try on prescriptions because of lousy service at Walgreen's. I submitted two scripts for something I checked out on their website. Ibuprofen 800mg and Lovastatin 20mg which I take daily. Their list said that they would be $4 for a thirty day or $10 for a 90.00 day supply. when I picked them up they said $20.00 so I assumed that I was getting 90 day supplies of both. when I got home there was a 30 day supply of Lovastatin that they charged me $9 for. I called and was told by some punk kid that I should have asked about it when I was there.He just kept saying it was my fault and I asked for a manager and got the pharmasist who told me I should have seen an astrick that meant that it would be higher. I went to the website and it said it may be higher in Wisconsin. MAYBE! I told her that things should be explained especially to new costumers and she said I should have asked. Good way to treat a new customer who won't be back.
*: the male pharmacist on the weekend, the one with really bad rug [toupee], was throwing empty bottle's around, and yelling at the other employee's.  he's always angry, god forbid you have to ask him for advice or interractions on prescrips.  

*: I refilled my dogs cough medicine and noticed it did not look the same as the first one. And the writing was not the same so I checked with me vet and was told the new cough med contained tylenol which would have killed my dog
*: Went in for an eye exam and purchased frames and lenses.  Received my eyeglasses and had them fitted.  Approx.  two weeks later I noticed the right lens seemed spider web.  Took them into the store to point this out and the rude woman acted as if i had never owned a pair of glasses before (i'm 36 years old and have worn glasses since high school).  She put it off as if I had scratched them when in reality, as I had pointed out her, the lens was etched.  The strange process continued over the next month until the entire center of the lens was covered with this snowflake like pattern.  I again returned to the store and the same rude woman was there.  I told her that this pattern wasn't scratches it was obvious that the lens were etched in the MIDDLE not the front or the inside of the lens.  The left lens has started to show just the slightest of etching on the upper edge of the lens.  The woman there said she didn't know what to do, that I would probably have to buy new lens.  The dr wasn't there the first time I stopped in but by the time i returned one month later there was a new dr and also said i would have to purchase new lens.

*: I am a diebetic who is very insulin resistant, I also have  Dystonia. I recently went to WalMart to get a refill of the insulin drug Novalog. I had only started using WalMart Pharamacy the prior month. I had gone into the medicare hole and was looking to get my drugs at a lower cost. When I went to get the Novalog I was told the insurance would not pay because my prescription was wrong.  I asked why nobody called me so I could have gotten the situation straightend out. The WalMart clerk told me they did not do that. She then proceeded to yell at me I only take 30 units a day and was even going to show me on a calulator,I did not know what she was talking about. I was told it was an issue with my insurance. I went home to talk with my insurance and was told they would override the block and I could pick up the three viles of needed insulin, and that I needed to call my doctor to get a new prescription. I called the doctor to get the prescription revised. The doctor's nurse called the pharmacy, the clerk told her 3 viles were ready to pick up, not mentioniong the prescription was written wrong. The doctor's nurse told me she had made it clear to the clerk the prescription was for 3 viles for 1 month I called back Walmart and asked if the prescription had been ammended. The clerk yelled at me that I only took 30 units of insulin a day and it was going to cost me $97.00 becase of the way the prescription was written and I had to pick up the whole order for $97.00, the insurance would not let me pick up only 1 vile.  I did not have that much money. It was a Friday and the doctors office was closed. I called the insurance again to see if I could get just one vile, They again told me I needed a new prescription. I tried Wallmart one more time to try to find out what the problem was for it was now around 6:00pm, I had been dealing with this since around 1:30 pm. I bypassed the clerks and asked to speak to a pharamicists. The pharamcists told me the prescription was written for 10ml for 3 months and not 30ml for 1 month. At 8:am on Sat. I got on the phone to the doctor on call, insulin is not a drug you do without . I was told to have the pharmacy call her. I called Walmart and was told they did not call doctors. I went to the same day clinic to get insulin, they told me to call the Dr. on call back, which I did. I received a call back from the doctor a short time later telling me she had told them to give the one vile until I could get it fixed on Mon. I called WalMart again and was told it would cost me still cost me $97.00 to pick up the one vile because the insurance would not let them break up the order. I called the insurance back and was told Wallmart was putting the information in wrong, and that was why it kept coming up $97.00  and they were not listing to them. I finally rememberd I had prescription at a Longs drug store and hoped I could get a refill on it. I called them and asked them to please fill it for me.  The WalMart Pharmacist called me and told me to come in and pick up the precription, it was for 30ml for 1 month at $30.00. I told her forget it I had taken care of the problem and hung up. She then called me back and said the insurance had stopped the payment to Longs The prescription was at Walmart. Because I knew it would take another day to get it straighted out, I was out of insulin and my blood sugar was at 400, My Dystonia was causing me to spasam I picked it up. I think I did figure what the clerk was talking about when she said I only took 30 units of insulin a day. I am on an insulin pump, I have a basil amount of insulin which is the amount the pump delivers to me and a bolus, which is the amount of insulin I give myself when I eat. 30 units of insulin is my base amount, befor I eat anything.
*: I was bringing my husband home from the hospital on January 6, 2009 after open heart surgery (actually 2 surgeries as the 2nd surgery was to stop the bleeding in his chest).  He was very weak and needed to go right home.  We stopped at Wal-mart in Concord, New Hampshire as we had several prescriptions to fill.  I was told it would be an hour.  I didn't much like that, but felt I could use the hour to pick up the special foods he would be needing while I was waiting for the scrips.  My daughter was with me and was in the car with my sick husband.  During my wait she had to bring him into the store (with all those germs!) so he could use the restroom as now the time had gone over the hour.  My husband was getting weaker.  When I had presented the prescriptions I informed the people at the pharmacy of my special need (that he was waiting in the car).  At most other places when dealing with a rather emergency situation allowances are made and people are taken out of turn.  To some people this may not sound fair, but there should be exceptions to every rule and as time went on I was told that they would not take us out of order.  Eventually, even after my continued pleading and tearful begging, my daughter left her father (my husband) in the car alone and sick.  She was furious and made no bones about telling the pharmicists how she was feeling. Now one hour and forty minutes had gone by and no prescriptions.  They scurried at that point and put them all in a bag by the cash register where we had to wait again for someone to serve us.  When we got home we found we were missing two prescriptions.  My husband had developed Diabetes while in the hospital and while we received the strips to check his blood sugar we did not receive the lancets.  We also did not receive a prescription that had been called in from the hospital earlier that day.  The pharmacy said they never received it!  Do I believe them?  Absolutely not!!  Why?  Because one of the clerks had told me already that it had been received.  That reminds me that earlier I had stood in line for 25 minutes only to find out that my prescriptions had not been filled yet.  That was when the hour was up so I then began the long wait I have previously mentioned.  

*: I went to Wal-Mart Pharmacy, Rolla, Missouri on 1-9-09 to request a copy of my families 2008 printout of medication summary expense for: myself, my husband, my 2 year old daughter, 8 year old son and 9 year old son.

*: My perscripions are never ready on time, the lines are always long and the staff are rude.  I'm a Sr. Gastroenterology Specialist for a large Pharmaceutical company and they treat me like I'm an uneducated idiot.  They always insist on making me wait for a pharmacy consult, even though my medications are refills, and the pharmacist never listens and shows any little interest in my business.  I'm just sick of getting treated like I'm in their way and causing them to actually work for a living. 
*: My husband took his prescriptions in to be refilled, all of them EXCEPT his diabetes medication was refilled. They informed him that he did not have any more refills on his diabetes medications. But he did he had previously had all of the prescriptions refilled at the same time, because the medicines all run out at the same time each month. He was in another state when he had Nov. prescriptions refilled with no problem (he took his empty medicine bottles in to the pharmacy in Rogers, Arkansas and these medications were refilled).
*: I was prescribed ** a narcotic pain medication for migraine and severe nerve damage in my back and elbows. I was only getting them for a couple of months from Walmart Pharmacy and I was only given 20-30 at a time w/ 1 refill. When I went to them for the very last time to pick up my refill on my medication I was told by them the refill was cancelled. I called my dr office and spoke to the nurse who told me I did have a refill. I then called the pharmacy back and told them according to the Dr I did have a refill, they again told me it was cancelled. 
*: For many months, I have been purchasing ** from the local Walmart in Tell City, IN. I got tired of waiting in line and sometimes only getting a partial refill, so I went to another local pharmacy to get **. I was getting my insurance card out when the pharmacist asked me if I wanted to pay cash. He said a month's supply was only $8.75. I said, "Something is wrong, because Walmart has been charging me $25.49 each month." He said that there was no mistake so I paid cash. 
*: Dropped  presc. off 12/23/08 was told to pick up 12/26/08.GOt tostore at 9:02 am at 10:oo am pharmacy opened .no one INCLUDING store manager had aclue who was supposed to open pharmacy .WHen Iasked for my meds which had beendropped off 3 DAYS before, Iwas told Iwould have to wait 
*: On 2 different occasions have need antibotic meds filled. First time had to wait til next day.Second time had to go back later in the day.I would think there could be an urgent fill and if only refills I don't mind waiting or going back.But if you are sick enough for phys.to give an antibotic the sooner you can get started the better.My granddaughter was running very high fever and really needed to be admitted to hospital;but she is a new mom and breast feeding.Thers have been other times unhappy with the wait but these really upset me.Please if you will consider a line for urget needs.Thank You Rachel Myers   
*: I went into your store last night and I had shopping to do and also needed to fill a prescription .  All the information was on the script so I sent my 13yr old granddaughter to the pharmacy to drop it off.  They refused to take the script without ID.  I understand needing to see ID to pick it up, but to drop it off is ridiculous.  I had to stop shopping to go back there just to drop off the script.  I do all my shopping at this store. Everything!!!!!!  I told them that I myself fill controlled substances all the time {one of which is Paxil}  and never once have been asked for my ID.  I gave them my ID and when I did it slid across the counter and on to the floor.  At first they would not pick the ID up and then refused to fill the script. The clerk which was a tall black woman about 47 yrs old and heavy set just kept running her mouth to me.  She said I was crazy and needed to take the medication I was on.  I called her a bitch. The medication I am on is because I saw my son hand himself, and that is no ones business, but my own.  Then she called my mother a bitch and threatened to come out from behind the counter and beat me up.  There were a lot of things said most of which I can't remember at this time.  Then when I turned and walked away she called my father a name.  My parents had nothing to do with any of this and they weren't even there. She could call me any name she wants, but why bring my innocent parents into it.  I reported it to the store manager and was promised I would hear back from him.  No word from him, so I called your corporate office.  A female there called me and made me feel as if I were a criminal.  I've been in retail for 25yrs and I know you can not talk to a customer like that.  I also know that word of mouth travels fast.  E-Mail even faster these days. One back word on you travels faster than five good words. That is a fact, and you can believe I will tell everyone I know about that pharmacy.  Every time I stand in line there all I hear is complaints about the people behind that counter.  Since Rick left the store it has a real cluster-mess!  You stand in line forever and then the rudeness is ridiculous.  I have threatened time and again to take my business elsewhere.  I have nothing more good to say about wal mart.  I used to brag about wal mart, no more!!!!
*: shouting my name) that she was just greeting me.  She became so agitated, that at the end of ringing up my purchases, she abruptly left the register,  with other customers (who were behind me in line), looking after her with amazement.  I didn't get her name, but the incident so upset me, that I called the store manager on my cell phone and reported her, identifying the register and the time of day and the area where she usually worked (the pharmacy).  I told the manager that what this clerk did and that it was un-called for and unprofessional.  He said he would speak to her.
*: I wanted my prescription filled. He refused. He Said unless you pay  $450.00 no deal. I called earlier that day it was supposed to be 50.00. I lost insurance in Oct.now I am self-pay. He knew there was no way I could afford to pay 450.00 for a prescription thats only 50 dollars. I am also contacting the Atty. Generals office in my state.
*: I was over charged for my prescription. Initially when I filled it I told the clerk that is wrong you are charging me for 4 months. She disagreed and said the computer ran it through the insurance and that is what you am to be charged. With that being said I was very upset and called United Healthcare myself. They in turn advised that the reason I was over charged was that Walmart ran my script through as a 31day dose when infact it should have been ran as a 28 day dose. I then called the pharmacy and spoke with the pharmacist who reviewed my presciption. I explained to her what had happened Since you have billed this as 31day dose the insurance has read it as if I was 9 days into my 4th month of medication. She said to me boy we do this all the time. I wonder why it charged you like this and nobody else? My response to her was that I am a medical office manager and am very well aware of my benefits. She agreed that had to be the reason. Anyway long story short she told me to come to the store and pick up my refund. When I went to the store that night the clerk made a call to another store about a patient other than myself. Normally I wouldn't and don't care. However I was so mortified when I heard her speaking on the PHONE. She state loud and clear the other patients name and date of birth!  I am very disturbed by this type of thing. There is so much crime and identity theft in the world today. We as providers are required to take into consideration the privacy of our patients. If this kind of thing can happen to that patient whose to say it hasn't happened to myself or others. I still have that womens name and date of birth in my head 2/2/1957, I will not release her name. Walmart has that program in their pharmacies, they train regular people. That is all fine and dandy. I'm all for the little guy getting some help to further himself. I am however very irritated that they are not teaching these individuals that is sort of thing is greatly frowned upon and a major HIPAA violation.     
*: For the fifth time in less than two months I picked up my presciption only to have the wrong amount or the wrong mg of the drug. The other four times I had to go back and get the correct amount after being treated like I had stolen the drugs. I was rudely spoken to by a pharmacy associate. I have MS and need certain meds to help me function during the day. I also suffer from daily migraines. The last thing I need is someone accusing me of stealing medicine. I talked with the store manager whom is a little on the  in experienced side to say the least. He offered me a $10 gift card for my trouble. I'm sorry but that didn't begin to cover the cost of the extra gas for the four extra trips I had to make. One of the times I picked up the extra meds they actually gave me the wrong mg of the medicine! I went back again today and again they didn't give me the correct amount. I always check now before I leave the store. The incompetent pharamcist just said he was sorry like it was no big deal. I stood there asking him how they could do this so many times and wondered how often others didn't catch these mistakes and were given the wrong doses and were hurt from it.
*: I had a prescription called in at 11:10 am I go to walmart after work at 5:20pm over 6 hours later and my perscription is still not ready!!! the clerk says its still being processed i said are you kidding me it was called in this morning. She walks away from me. No explaination no time frame...she walks away from me. I am sorry but i would rather pay triple for my perscription that have to wait more than six hours for it. In this day time is money!! Reasoning per the store manager...well its the first of the month.
*: The Wal-Mart pharmacy is a nightmare. The staff is unbelievably rude and nasty to customers. In addition, prescriptions are always incorrect. I recently received a prescription refill which was not even the drug I had requested. I called to get it fixed, and the man who took my call was trying to refill yet another drug which was not what I was requesting. The pharmacists are incompetent, the pharmacy manager is just as unprofessional and nasty as the cashiers. I have complained to the DE Board of Pharmacy because every time I go to that pharmacy, the line is absurdly long because there is something wrong with every prescription they fill... and that's only those of us who check before leaving. 
*: Humalog and Lantus diabetis insulin pens were unrefrigerated when removed from double plastic shopping bag from pharmacy and pharmacy paper bag and checked at home 45-55 minutes after pick-up.

*: I took my refill prescription into a local Wal-Mart Pharmacy.  This was the third time I had submitted this particular prescription.  My fiancÃ©e and I were in a hurry due to a family emergency, and only wanted to drop off the prescription and come back when we could later to pick it up.  For this reason I jumped out of the car and ran into the pharmacy counter.  When I turned in the prescription the assistant asked for an ID.  In my hurry I left my purse since I wasn't planning on picking up or paying for the prescription until later.  When I stated that I did not have my ID, the assistant looked to the pharmacist for his response.  Sam--ironically that was his name--replied that I should know that the prescription required an ID.  Although in my previous two refill prescription visits an ID was not required until I picked up the prescription, I hurried out to my car.  Upon returning I commented that the policy must have changed since my last refill. The pharmacist overheard me and said that I should have known an ID was required when presenting this prescription for refill.  I stated that the law must have changed since my refill six months ago. He stated that the law always required an ID.  By this time, I was ready to go.  He was still holding my prescriptions looking at me for a response with the assistant standing beside him looking uncomfortable.  I stated that since they had not required an ID upon submitting the prescription that they must have been breaking the law.  The pharmacist then handed me my prescriptions and said, "You want me to fill your prescriptions and then report me for breaking the law. I think not."  I said to please take the prescriptions knowing that I needed to hurry.  I am upset because Sam threatened not to refill my prescriptions and acted as though he was doing me a favor.  
*: Trying to get a prescription filled at this pharmacy is a nightmare. They have to be some of the rudest people I have ever dealth with. I work with the public and would be fired if I treated people the way they do.  I called to get a refill on my medication and they said it could not be filled per DR. orders, and that they had talked to the DR. that morning. I then called the DR. office myself and nobody there had talked to the pharmacy. So the Dr. office was nice enough to call and talk to the pharmacist and staighten it out. Then they made me wait 2 hours before they filled the prescription. And I had already had to go through the whole night with no pain meds.
*: I receive a letter from WM about a HEART medication I received from WM Pharmacy. RECALL of isosorbide mononitrate.  I called the Pharmacy Had to wait 10 moin. talk to Pharm. 'Too Busy' was the reply when asked why.

*: I dropped two prescriptions off at 12 pm by two different DR's, was told they would be ready at 2:00 pm, went back at 2:50 pm and was asked if I was still on Tricare, never have had Tricare insurance have been getting my medication filled there for over 3 years, was told they weren't ready, i asked why didn't they give me a courteousy call to let me know this since I needed the antibiotic the pharamcist Ms. Allen got rude with me and not saying I was right but I was rude right back, she informed me that that was her damn pharmacy, i instructed her to just give me my prescriptions back and i would take them elsewhere, as i was getting them back, i asked the cashier what the problem had been and when ms allen informed me to get my precriptions and leave, i work at a prison and was in my uniform she called my work and spoke with my supervisor and informed him i was banned from the walmart pharmacy, i am no lawyer but she had no buisness calling my supervisor and informing him i was banned from there when i haven't been told, she also states that she has it on video tape and that would be fine with me because there are two sides to a story and then she could be seen and heard being rude herself. 
*: My doctor faxed in a script for me on 11/12.  I went in Sunday to get the script.  The two people there looked and said they had not recd any script.  They did not offer to call my doctor just said that sometimes it is called in to Walgreens by mistake so just check at Walgreens.  Which I did and they did not have the script either.  So Monday I called the Dr office.  The nurse checked with Walmart because she had faxed it and recd a confirmation.  Walmart phamacy said their fax machine has not been working right for a week. This was not a script I needed right away however what has been happing in the last week with the scripts that are needed right away?  And why if there was a problem with the fax would the clerk not say we will check on it and call the dr office.  The clerk did not even ask if it was something I needed right now or if it had been filled there before (which it had)  There was no consider about what might be the affect on me the patient.  I know Walmart is a business but it is in this case a pharmacy which concerns my health.  I would of at least liked her to ask if it is a med I needed right away.  I would of liked them to say they call the dr to see what happened.  And I bet you would rather they did not say go to Walgreens and check to see if the script was there.  It would of been just as easy for me to tell the nurse to just call it to Walgreens instead of Walmart since there was not any concern or even customer service.  I do not want to see anyone lose their jobs in these tough times however I would think that you would like to see some customer service so that you can maintain your current customers at this Walmart Phamacy. It is something I will be watching to see if there are any future problems.  

*: This Month and last month we, both my husband and myself requested refills at this location and the people there are all giving bad service , there is always a long line waiting and most of the people have been in line for hours or have been told to come back in a couple of hours and still have to wait over an hour to have the prescription filled. These people are rude. The patients who are there need their medicines and are sometimes sick themselves and they have to come back two or three times the same day. If there is a lot of demand and they are overloaded with prescription orders then why not hire an additional person to help them out. The cashiers need to be retrained to be more efficient than they are now. Sometimes the clerk takes too long to take care of a person because she has to go back and forth too many times looking for who knows what. This time I saw and heard so many people complaining to the pharmacist that it is ridiculous. Last month I was given 3 prescriptions of the same medicine but with different dosages. They blame the Dr's Office and I don't know what happened but they need to be more careful. Then the pharmacist said to keep the medicine, that maybe the doctor will change the dosage again and I can use it later, he did not offer to take it back and give me credit for the medicine until I was furious and I insisted to the clerk who was smirking and making comments which made me madder.They need lessons how to treat patients and anyone they deal with. We are the customers and deserve to be treated with respect. Please check this matter and try to correct this. We do not have any other pharmacies closer in the south side of town and there are a lot of people who use your service including the surrounding communities who are to this side of town. We will be changing to another pharmacy and I feel for the low income people who have trouble finding transportation to go into town to get their medicines especially if they are sick. Thank you for you cooperation in advance. I tried to contact the store director but was transferred and put on hold for a long time so I gave up. That is another problem because when calling sometimes they do not answer not even in 15 rings and then you are disconnected without talking to anyone. I know and understand they are busy but how can you justify the kind of service they we are being provided with. We have had two other pharmacists who have been there and they know us by name and there is never lines that are that long or do not have people complaining while waiting patiently for their medicines. I wish I had the names of those two other pharmacists so you could praise them for the good service they have giving to this community which is growing on our side of town.
*: i went to walmart today to pick up a refill on my  prescription and they had not filled it and said they needed to cal the doctor.  This was a refill on my monthly prescription.  I went home and called them back and read my prescription to them and they said ok and I asked them to hold it for me as i would not be back in this town until next week and they said they could not hold the refill for more than 6 days per the laws.but my daughter's pharmacy holds them for 15 days. I then told them that maybe I should go to another pharmacy and they were very rude and said they would happily send my prescriptions to another pharmacy.  i live 35 miles away from them and give them my weekly business and I feel I was being treated rudely and that they dont care about my business or my health.
*: I went to the pharmacy to drop my son's prescription, I asked them how long it would be they told me 40 minutes. I decide to stay in the store and wait. I go back after 40 minutes. the girl that was there said they had alot of prescriptions and it would be another 30 minutes. I decided well i might as well wait, when i go back after 30 minutes they tell me it would be another 25 minutes.I stayed and waited,when I went back the last time they still did't have it ready, the girl said they were filling it right then and it would be ready in less than 10 minutes.I couldn't wait any longer my son was sick and I was frusterated. I left and went home.The next day I went to pick up my prescription and take it somewhere else to get filled. The other pharmacy had it ready in 15 minutes. 
*: I filled my prescription at Wal-Mart on Saturday night 11/8/08 on Sunday Morning 11/9/08 I opened the bottle and it looked like there wasn't much in there. So I counted them my prescription was for 16 and there were only 11 in the bottle. So I called the pharmacy. I told them what happened and the pharmacist immediately told me that if there was two check marks written on the bottle than that means the associate counted it, and there is nothing that they can do for me. I called the store manager and a couple of other people and everyone said that the only person that can help me is the pharmacist. So I talked to that pharmacist again with a store manager present and the remedy she offered was I will refund you for the 5 pills and call your Dentist and tell them what you claim happened. Never once did they offer to do a count of their meds. And they were blaming me. It should be noted that my prescription was for Valium which I understand is a narcotic and I understand that they can't just go trusting every customer that says that they are missing some, but on the same note they should not be putting all their trust in one associate either. I did clarify this and it was a single person who counted my prescription. I called the store back and told the store manager that I think this is very bad practice. The other thing that really caught me off guard about this pharmacy is that not a single person asked for any kind of identification. I was telling my husband in the store that I thought it to be very odd. It was my first time ever picking up meds from there and all they asked me for is my name and they don't even know that I am the person on that prescription. Also I am concerned about their child safety lock. I don't even think that there is one. 
*: On 9-15-08, about 5:30 p.m. after having oral surgery, I brought 3 prescriptions to A Sacramento  Walmart Pharmacy to be filled.  One of them was Vicodin 5-500mg for 30 tablets.  I picked up the prescriptions about an hour later and went home.  I opened the bottles and noticed that the Vicodin wasn't very full, so I counted the pills.  There were 20 pills instead of 30, which is what the prescription was for and the bottle also stated 30 qty.  I started calling the Pharmacy about 6:45, since they close at 7 p.m., but they did not answer.  I called the store after 7 and spoke to a Manager who sent an e-mail to the Pharmacist.   Since then I've spoken to Walmart's Loss Prevention (who never got back to me), and filed a complaint with the BBB (which Walmart replied with, what is the store #).  I also spoke to the Pharmacist the next day and she told me they were not off on their counts on Vicodin and that the prescription was double counted.  I did not sign for that prescription stating that is was true & correct, nor did I check it before I left the store.  Either the 2  people who filled the bottle didn't put 30 in or they put 30 in and someone else tampered with it & took 10 out before I picked it up.  They do NOT seal  the bags prescriptions (controlled substances) are stored in behind the counter.    I paid for 30 and took home 20 of a controlled substance and feel I am being ignored.  For a matter of principle and integrity, I would like this investigated and resolved.  What bothers me the most is that someone can TAMPER with a persons prescription and get away with it.  If they can take something out, they could just as easily put something in - that's a scary thought.  They said they would watch their tapes and report this to the DEA but I've heard nothing from them, even after asking for the DEA case #.   SO, IF YOU MUST USE A WALMART PHARMACY, COUNT YOUR PILLS AT THE COUNTER , IN FRONT OF THE CASHIER, ON CAMERA, BEFORE YOU PAY AND LEAVE THE STORE.  ESPECIALLY IF IT IS A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.    This was not a $4. prescription - now I know how they can afford to do that program.     
*: On Thursday, Oct 30 2008 I went to the HopeMills Road Walmart Store in Fayetteville NC. I needed to refill my daughters prescription (birth controls that are being used to treat some cysts and help regulate some feminine problems she is having). The first prescription she received was later on changed by her Dr.due to a reaction and she was put into something more suitable. While speaking to the young girl at the counter, I asked her if there was any problem about refilling my daughter's birth control prescription at this store since I submitted her order in a near store the last time I ordered her pills. She said no problem, it will take a day or two. She asked her name, birthday and she said that she got it and that was it. I picked up the prescription Saturday and left. It turned out that they have filled the previous prescription. I understand the error, however I called the store where the original prescription was submitted and they said they have the lates prescription in the system also to contact the other pharmacy to check if they will exchange or refund the wrong prescription. When I contacted the pharmacy, a woman who was either in a rush or in a very early mad mood. I explained to her the situation and ask if the prescription could be refunded or exchange since it was intact and untouched. According to this woman (Andrea-the pharmacist)this was my error and I should have known what I was ordering. I explained to the lady that according to my recollection, that's what I thought I have done. I went to one of her professionals, I was asked a couple of questions(actually, I asked the questions pertaning the order) and I was told that everything will be ok and ready the next day. 

*: I'm deeply dissapointed in the kind of service I received from the Walmart Pharmacy dept. The cashier was open and when I walked up, she looks at me and walks away!  No, I'll be with you in just a second or anything like that. I waited for almost 5min until another cashier walked by and I asked her if the other cashier was going to come back since I saw that she was chit-chatting with her co-workers in the back. Recently, Walmart's pharmacy dept gave the adult dosage to my friend's son who was only 6yrs old. Luckily, she was able to catch it before she gave it to him. Lesson learned, FROM NOW ON I'LL PAY $$$$ MORE SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE I CAN GET SOME SERVICE.
*: Overcharged for several items.  3 pack locking plyers shelf priced $4.00 charged 22.88, 16 0z. hammer shelf priced $5.88, charged $10.88 and combo wrench set shelf priced $4.88, charged $6.88.  Also, 2 shelves worth of 2 different tool boxes (that I did not purchase, but scanned) marked $6.97, scaned at 15.88 and 22.97 and tool belt shelf marked 2.88 scanned at $22+.

*: RX NEEDED A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION, THE PHARMACIST GAVE THE PATIENT THE INFORMATION AND DID NOT NOTIFY OUR OFFICE. Pharmacist also told patient that an rx for albuterol nebules 0.63mg, did not come in that strengh the dr. will have to change the rx to .083%. When calling the pharmacy to get needed information for doing the required PA for the meds, I was told they gave that information to the mother, and to contact her. Also, pharmacist working stated she was a fill-in and this was not her normal store and she did not know what to do. How is this considered customer service. The child in question has pneumonia and needs the medication as soon as possible and your pharmacy is prolonging treatment because they don't know what to do.
*: I went to have a prescription filled for my 13 mo old daughter. I said, I have never been here before, do you need anything from me? The pharmacy tech told me no, and asked for my daughter's name and birthdate several times. I was later told my charge would be over $100, and was told that I had refused to provide my insurance information. Since my daughter has an infection and a very high fever, I told the pharmacist, Sorry, I'm in a hurry, but I want this medicine, as my daughter has a very high fever. The pharmacist responded, I don't rush anything and also indicated, I'm concerned too. He said the best way to lower a high fever would be to place her in a cool shower. Overall, I found both staff to be highly rude to me and very inefficient.
*: On October 13th in the morning that day, I called WalMart pharmacy to order refills for two prescription drugs.  Next day, at about 5:00 pm (almost 30 hours after I'd placed phone refill request), I drove to WalMart (3.5 miles from my home in heavy traffic) to pick up my prescription refills.  The line was very long (about 10 people) for pick-up, so I went into the 'super-store' grocery section to pick up a few items.  At about 5:30pm, I went back across the store to the pharmacy to pick up my prescription refills.  After about a five-minute wait, I was told by the pharmacy assistant that one out of the two drugs was unavailable at that particular store.  It was a drug I must take each morning, and I cannot do without the drug.  I was told (after about 10 more minutes of 'wait' time) that I would have to get it at another WalMart location (which meant I had another 30 mins. drive in the dark and traffic that night).  I complained that someone should have called me to tell me that the particular drug was unavailable at my preferred and closest WalMart, especially since I'd given them almost 30 hours to fill the two prescriptions.  At that time the 'clerk'/assistant went back to the other pharmacists (and another assistant); they talked covertly, then

*: After breaking my glasses I thought I would just run to Walmart and get a new pair made biggest mistake I ever made. On the day of my appointment I should have seen that it was not going to be a good day. I was the first appointment of the day and had a 9:30 the doctor didn't even show up till 9:45 and I didn't get in the office till 10:00 i was told to come back in a week to pick up my glasses, well it has been two weeks now and still no news on when they will be in and no reason for them not being there was given to me till after the thrid time I called them. And all of this after I payed in advance I would not advise anyone to go there for glasses 
*: Prescriptions never ready on time. Month supply 8.00 instead of $4.00 as advertised.
*: I got a Rx filled for **, which I have been taking for thirty yrs. When I called in the refill and looked at the bottle, I noticed they had written it for twice the dosage. Instead of .1mg it was .2 mg, which could have been a terrible accident had I not known how to take the medication already, and so did not pay attention to the Wal-Mart Rx dosage.
*: This is not the first time this has happened to me. My husband needs ** and it is on 4.00 list. Well the first time they told me my insurance didn't cover it so had to go to doc and have them call it in no problem. After 2 months of paying for it. Finally got it. Am also doing ** for cancer and took it in and after a week - had to have doc fax same one back as they lost that one too. Tried to talk to them and finally just gave up. AS we would of payed the 4.00 as I know it is on the list and told the girl and showed her but just blew me off. Was so mad I didn't even get her name. I worked for this store for 10 yrs and I know Lou ** would never accept this kind of disrespect. My husband needs his meds and they didn't offer to call or anything else and the deer in the headlight stare was enough to just burn me. Thanks for time.
*: I dropped off my prescriptions at 10:00 am to be filled, when I went back at 3:00pm they were not filled, and I was told they were marked to fill for the next day.
*: First off I travel back and forth from Ohio to New Mexico. I have a Ohio id. That is not expired and is valid anywhere in the us. I have always gone to Walmart pharmacy. This time the women at the drop off desk refused to fill my meds. She claimed it was because of my Ohio id. She also very rudely said it's about time I get a New Mexico id! So I went to Walgreens and they filled it, no questions asked. I told them about the problem with Walmart. And they said it doesn't matter as long as the id isn't expired. Which made me even more upset. I plan to remove my monthly meds from Walmart even though Walgreens is much more money, they are not rude.
*: Stopped to fill a prescription10/11/08. No others around. Could only fill one because Dr. neglected to put dose on script. No offer to call Dr. office. But remember you get what you pay for, CHEAP drugs, CHEAP service. You do the math!! I had to laugh. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY SERVICE AT WALMART, GOOD OR BAD. JUST PUT THE SAVING IN YOUR POCKET!!! You get what you pay for.
*: I dropped off my prescriptions and when I went to pick up my meds they told me that my meds only came in 500 or 1000mgs and that they needed to contact my dr. They said they called and nobody answered not even the receptionist. I wanted my prescriptions back and they couldn't find them. They called Walgreens and Walgreens had 850mg medicine. So what's the deal with the people that's hired?
*: Saturday, 10/4/08, I went to Walmart Pharmacy to pick up my husband's blood pressure medication. He advised me that our physician's office had electronically submitted the prescription on 10/3/08 at his request. They were trying a few different prescriptions for him and this was one that was chosen by the physician and would be paid for by our medical insurance. I waited for about 10 minutes in line until it was my turn. There were 2 women waiting on customers and at least one or two pharmacists working that day. 
*: Went to Walmart Phamacy with my brother who (HAS CANCER) was checking on a prescription that he had left a day before. When he asked the pharmacist if the medicine had come in, the man screamed at him and said, I TOLD YOU TO COME IN AFTER 2. My brother asked him if he was not allowed to come in the store to check and the Walmart Pharmacist backed off and never apologized. I noticed a female customer walking by,who shook her head and rolled her eyes and gave the Walmart Pharmacist a, ARE YOU KIDIING ME LOOK! My brother asked him if his other prescription was ready and the man checked and said it was ready. 
*: While physical damage did not occur, I have been the brunt of rudeness from this pharmacist, one too many times.  I will be moving my prescriptions.    On the first occasion I was trying to explain what the doctor had asked me to tell the pharmacist when I turned in the prescription and Brian interrupted me in mid-sentence.  I ignored this and continued.  He let out a huffy breath as if dealing with me customer was bothering him.    
*: Service at the pickup window for precriptions is just unbelieveable,You wait in line 30 to 45 minutes while personell are just milling around or hid in one of the non preciption lanes prentending to be working, I will be changing drug stores asap because it has been a problem for 4 years now and there is no effort to fix it. 
*: I made a call to the Pharmacy to find out how much it would cost out of pocket for (21) 800 mg ** tablets. I was connected to Joe (he did not give his last name). He did indicate he was the pharmacist and after that he tone was extremely rude, he seemed very irritated and when I asked the question he answered me abruptly and when I asked 4.00 dollars for 21 tablets? He sarcastically and in a louder voice spelled four. I hung up at this time and felt it would be more professional of me to contact you. At no time did I retaliate verbally. I am a professional hospital care-worker and even on a bad day I try to treat my patients with care and speak to them in the same manner that I wish to be spoken to. Mr. Joe needs to understand that I could have just as well been a relative of one his bosses etc. This occurred on September 17th 2008 at approx. 2:20 pm.
*: The pharmacy is understaffed.  I go there two or three times a month for prescriptions and last Thursday the line was out into the store isles.  I went back on three occasions because I kept thinking the lines would be better later and the third time I went back I stood in line for 35 minutes because they had one lady working the register.  
*: This is the second time I've had to register a complaint about this pharmacy and it's eveving staff!  On Tuesday, 9-9-08, I called to inform them that there was an error in regard to the prescription placed the evening before.  It took 3hrs. to get someone to answer the phone, only to be told that the pharmacist was too busy to address my concerns. So I went over there.  The line was unbeleivable!! 
*: The attitudes of the counter attendants is brash, rude and smart alecky. they speak to the customers in a subserviant manner and act like they don't care if you get your medicines or not. or if you have to wait an etraordinary aamount of time. the last two times I used the pharmacy on sept 3rd and sept 10th 2008. they told me I would have to wait for 3 hours. There is normally only one pharmacist on duty and it normally only takes @ 20 minutes. The pharmacist is good. the problems lie with the counter attendants. They just don't care and have no feelings for the sick.
*: I called in to have a prescription re-filled; the woman told me I had no prescription; I asked to speak with the pharmacist and she hung up.  Little did she know I was in the store. I went to the pharmacy and asked why is there always a problem getting my prescriptions refilled?  The pharmacist said he doesn't know.  He asked me for my name and the prescription number.  He went on to say the prescription had been cancelled by someone in the Baldwin Park store.  The pharmacist called over to that store, only to be told someone hit the wrong key.  I had to wait over an hour to get this prescription.  
*: In July 2008, I went to the new Wal-Mart and had my prescriptions transferred for the sake of convenience. When I went to pick up my **, after calling it in several days ahead, they did not have a full bottle in stock and gave me a couple days worth. With the price of gas I prefer to limit my trips to the store each week, they did not even bother to call to say they were out.
*: I have been having my prescriptions filled at Wal-Mart and using the $4 plan they have. Not because I can't afford the prescriptions as I do have insurance, but my mother does not and so it was more convenient to have them all done at once.  I got a new prescription from my doctor 6-19-2008 and when it was filled it said 12 refills available, in other words the prescription was good for 12 months worth of medicine.    When I got a refill on 7-21-2008 my refills said 9 available.  So yesterday 8-25-2008 I asked the pharmacy tech why this number difference, she was unaware and she asked the pharmacy manager. [She] was very rude. I told her she was rude she said yes. 
*: I went to pick up my prescription today. I was aking Amber why this prescription cost 5.00 a pill with 10 pills inside when 2 months ago they charged me $15.00 a pill with 10 pills inside? I had called yesterday about this prescription and the girl ask if I had insurance. I have always had insurance thru Baylor hospital and they have always covered it. I even get 10 pills several time for a total of $4.00 a bottle. 
*: On Aug 17, 2008 I received a prescription for ** 50 mcg. Imagine my surprise the next day after I was already using the medication, when I became aware that the prescription was expired... 5 MONTHS AGO.
*: I was put in the hospital with a serious throat problem. I was in the hospital for 2 days.  After the 2 days I was told I  could go home and was told to pick up a couple perscriptions. When the dr asked where she should fax the perscription, I told her Wal-Mart because my parents were getting their perscriptions there and it was on the way home to my parents house. As I said, I had just  been discharged and was feeling weak and not well at all.  When we arrived at the counter, I was told that they were to busy to get my perscription. I told them that it had been faxed in about an hour and a half ago. It was  about 6 p.m. on June 16 2008. 
*: this is just one on the things that has happened at walmart pharmacy. I got there at 1:30 on sunday (8-10-08) and was told they were closing for 30 mins for lunch. I was alright with that , but at 2pm, they did not open and the clerks went on break for 10 more minutes. the pharmacist was VERY RUDE. He said they punched out late. I was there and they punched out at 1:30. I told him it was not our fault they punched out late and he said it was not his fault either.  
*: This was my first visit ever to the pharmacy at Walmart. I knew I'd be shopping there, so I asked my doctor to please fax my ** prescription over there, and I went over to pick it up. Nancy assisted me at the pharmacy desk, and was not very friendly, but that was the least of my worries. She asked for my name and grabbed a bag from the rod, without really looking at it. When I looked at the bag, it said **. I told her that's not what I take, and she was rude to me and said that it's the generic version. I explained that I always get the generic version, and I know it's not called **. She didn't even look at me. She just stated in an irritated and rude manner, as if I'm just stupid - that it's all explained in the booklet, and that I can take it out and read it when I get home.
*: My husband dropped off a prescription for me on 08/07/08 at approximately 11:30 am was told prescription would be ready in 45 minutes.  I had just got out of surgery so decided to go home. At 4:00 pm my husband went back to pick up my prescription and was informed they could not fill it cause the doctor forgot to put a date on it.  my husband asked if they called the doctor they said no cause they needed the date on the original prescription.  My husband then asked why they did not call us at home to make us aware of this problem.  They said it was not their responsibility to call.  
*: I went to the Pharmacy at 9 A.M., August 7th 2008, to pick up my perscription, but found the Pharmacy  closed.  The store manager was called, but he did not have the card needed to open the door.  A pharmacist was clled to come to the store.  An hour and a haft later the pharmacist arrived and opened the door.  Many seniors had to leave without getting their medicine, because they were using the Bushnell shuttle.
*: I dropped my prescrips at the window first one in line on 7/13/08. She said about 20 min. wait, ok. Went back in 30 min. wasn't ready yet, ok another 10min. They called about 5 people ahead. I asked again, not ready yet. I had seen a bag lying there didn't know if it was mine. I waited 1 hr. in all. Asked again and she grabbed the bag and said it just came down the line. Very Poor service! My time is important too! On 7/23/08 I had a similar experience, I needed to fill a prescription for Eye drops. I waited 1 hr then they told me they did not have them. You tell me why they did not know right when the prescription in it would tell them. I was sitting right there the whole time. Very disappointing in Walmart. No damage, but very frustrating.
*: I submitted about ten percriptions to the pharmacy tech,Monica, on July 30,2008. I told her that I only needed three of the ten, and to put the rest on hold until I needed the rest filled. She told me that, it would be no problem. I asked her what the wait time would be. She replied, about two hours. 
*: I turned a prescription in for 2mg ** @45 on July 22nd or 23rd. I still had some of the medication and would not run out till Friday (25th) or Saturday (26th). (Rx440629 date 6/24/08). I sent my wife Carolyn over to get it at 5:00pm on Friday the 25th of July. Wal-Mart indicated they had NO prescription. I asked my wife to put the pharmacist on. A Brian ** came on and exclaimed: I needed to have the Doctor write a prescription on every refill? He had to look the medication up and let me know this was the rule.
*:    Walmart has my prescriptions so messed up I don't know where to start.  When I was Karen Simms they gave my anti-depressants to another person.  Now I am Karen V..  They gave me the right medicene but with the information with another Karen V..  When I called about this they were very OH WELL WHO CARES ATTITUDE.  I thought everything was straightened out but when I called to refill my prescriptions I couldn't get them refilled because the phone numbers did not match.  So I had to wait until the next day to talk to a human.  My prescriptions were on hold.  They could not even explain why.  I had to go over all my information again. It really makes my nervous that they can not get my medicene straight.  Two of my prescriptions are for anxiety and depression. I have some really bad side effects. What if the other Karen V. or other Karen S. had taken these pills? One of my pills I used to take affected my heart beat. It is scary. I used to trust the pharmacy more than the doctor. Now I trust no one.
*:    On July 23, 2008, I took two percriptions to the pharmacy, at about 4:30pm. I asked when they would be ready, the reply was in about two hours. I returned at 7:00pm. I was told I didn't have anything. I told them I had hand carried them in at 4:30, they searched. They found both on top of their computer, where incomplete percriptions are placed. I was told that they could not fill the order because the volume had not been put down.They told me, they would call to get it complete, and would call me back if they received an answer. I didn't hear anything.
*: I weent to get two prescriptions filled at 11.30 AM today and i asked the girl haw long it would take. She  said awile and I said I would like to know because I didn't want to drive home and come back at that time a male pharmisist came over to me and said that it would take an hour to transfur the prescription from another Pharmacy and that If I didnt like it I should take my prescription and go back to Right Aid my previous Pharmacy. I told him that I am a customer and he had no right to talk to me that way and that I was just asking questions and he said that she gave me answers and that I just did not like the answers.
*: i drop my prescriptions off at 10 am i was it would be ready in about hour. I came back at 8:45 pm and to my suprise myprescription had not been filled! I was told that they need authorization first. I asked why wasn't i called then it is now over 8 hours later the cashier at the pharmarcy told me they had 500 prescriptions they didn't have time to call. But i explain to her that the other pharmisit did it before i really need my medication and i felt that they were being very insinitive to the situtation. 
*: When the pharmacist filled my child's prescription, she consulted me and told me to dispense 2ml 4 times daily and not to follow the instructions that SHE stuck on the box with my child's name on it that show 4ml 4 times daily.  After 2 days of giving my child 2ml per dosage, the 60ml bottle was practically finished.  I called the doctor and she said the prescription was for 7 days. 
*: On 7-2-08, my 96 year old father was given the wrong medicine. He was given 1500mg of a muscle relaxer. Why the pharmacist did not question the dose or need on a 96 year old man, I don't know. He should have received ** for C-diff. He was on the medicine for 8 days before the error was found. In the meantime he got weaker and weaker. He then ended up in the hospital and now is in a rest home. Hopefully he will recover from this but I sure think some sort of measure should occur that this would not happen.
*: What happen to my card, I file a police report. I called Walmart corporate and they all agree that they saw me put the card inside the slot but after that it just vanished. As one walmart corporate employee puts it, like magically vanishes. I look at the employee do something then look strange ask that I put my card in after she pull the slot in and my card went missing. I was assured that the machine must have eaten it although it would be the first time because the card was just gone. 
*: Per my request and my prescription insurance coverage, my doctor writes 90-day scripts. On two occasions Walmart #3990 has not filled the scripts as written. On the first occasion, 3 months ago, I noticed before I left the store. It was corrected and I advised that in the future they should issue the item as the doctor had written the script for. Last week I did not notice until I got home. This time it was for a non drug item and has no chance of inappropriate use. The item comes in boxes of 100 and the doctor wrote it for 200 items total, which would last the required 90 days +10. I wrote a letter a week ago and have not received a response. One 90-day scripts are less expense than 30 day scripts and I don’t have to drive the 60 miles round trip to retrieve as often.
*: These people treat you as if you committing a crime when you need a RX filled for narcotic type medications. They have gone so far as reviewing all of my medications before filling my RX. This last time was it! The pharmacist refused to fill my RX the way it was written by my orthopedic surgeon. She stated they were giving me too much. I literally just had joint supplement surgery. Who do they think they are to second guess my doctor? Not only that, they talk down to you and treat you as if you are a criminal or a strung out drug addict. I will never use Walmart Pharmacy again!
*: There needs to be a ZERO stars option! This is the Walmart Pharmacy on Debarr Rd, Anchorage Alaska. Pharmacy experience was horrible! (Backstory: my adult son had oral surgery, first surgery in his life). Drove to this pharmacy knowing it would take time to fill. Had to take him because of identification and insurance. #1 I was told 20-25 minutes. There is one Pharmacist (D) and 3 pharmacy techs working. We go grab post-surgical foods and items to make recovery easier/more tolerable. Give them extra time (50 minutes).
*: Been filling my **, ** and ** through Walmart for over two years now... Every month. Without ANY warning, last minute, they can no longer fill "controlled substances prescribed by my doctor", and of course no further reasoning could be provided. I still don't know if it's because of me, if it's only controlled substances by my Doc, or if they've blacklisted my Doc altogether. These pharmacists know full well that a sudden stop in a benzodiazepine will cause seizures and other serious side effects, including DEATH. Thanks for the heads up! Literally giving me no time to communicate with my doctor until last minute. Going 3 days without ** and ** will more than likely kill a person, so thank you for that... ** YOU! TAKING MY BUSINESS TO WALGREENS!
*: This is for the Walmart Pharmacy in Manchester MO. I dropped off 4 prescriptions all on one paper. I was going to pick them up in a few days. I called to check on them today and was told they do not have the prescriptions! I am absolutely livid! I went to them because they have the cheapest prices but I would go elsewhere to get more professional, less irresponsible.
*: Wife had a heart attack. Prescribed ** for pain after surgery. Walmart pharmacy in Charleston Illinois wouldn't fill the prescription because my wife also uses this medicine for arthritis. Her heart doctor knows this and prescribed it. Walmart pharmacist has more knowledge than a heart surgeon, family doctor, critical care nurse, or anyone else with a medical degree. That is what they think is true. I took the prescription to another pharmacy, and it was filled without question.
*: The "high on her own horse" pharmacist needs to be fired. She's mean, and unprofessional. And if you "refused" to fill my script, WHY didn't you call me??? Too busy not trying to drown in this rainy weather with your nose stuck WAY too high up.. It's rainin' lady.. Hope you don't melt! Actually wish you would!
*: Okay I've had the same medicine and dose for over 12 years and because some person checks the wrong box, I have to wait. You owe me money! My time is valuable! Please stick your policy and procedure up. And send me a check for 100 dollars for my time. Geez sick of this! Get a release form for the customer. Some of us are medical persons and don't need your spiel. Matter of fact the pharmacist just let me go one week and didn't do his job of policies!!!
*: Don't know what they are doing. Pharmacy Cynthiana Ky. My Dr called in 4 prescriptions and they ran none of them through my insurance. Told me one was going to be 295.00 with my insurance, funny thing is the cash cost of this drug is 300.00 meaning insurance company only will pay 5???? So I called back and said I can't pay that, so I was told then it was 69.00 with my insurance, called my Dr back and told him to send a generic in pill form as I could not afford to pay for these medications and then called the insurance company to complain and was told they ran none of them through the insurance. Called Walmart back and told them and they said, "Oh yeah, we thought you wanted the CASH PRICE." Really!!!! So then ran it though insurance and was told my copay was zero. OMG. It's like pulling teeth to get things filled at that pharmacy.
*: Went in to pick up my RX for antibiotics. Was informed they were in the process of filling it, but would be going to lunch soon, and I would have to wait an hour and a half for it to be ready. Every experience I've had at Walmart Pharmacy has been poor. The staff are rude and show little to no compassion for the patients and their needs. They will NEVER go out of their way to make your experience easier. It is clear that they simply do not care about the people in front of them. In the past I have chosen Walmart simply because the costs are lower than other pharmacies, but Walmart has officially lost my business. I would rather pay a little more at a pharmacy that cares about their patients and treats them with the respect they deserve.
*: The pharmacist refused to come off break to dispense post-surgical painkillers, causing a medical emergency. She is now under investigation by the Virginia Board of Pharmacy for violating the Controlled Substances Act and gross negligence.
*: Because of past experiences at WalMart's Pharmacy (nearly 15 years), I always call ahead to make sure my mom's prescriptions are ready for pickup before going to pick them up. I renewed 3 of her prescriptions by phone on a Friday afternoon knowing that as new prescriptions were needed from the doctor's office it would likely be Monday late before they were available. 
*: The prices are good, but it's wait, wait, and wait some more. Even if my doctor calls in the prescription and I wait to pick it up until the next day, it's a long wait. I have tried the online refill, same thing. You should be able to walk in, pick it up and pay and be done. Now if I take a new prescription in and leave it at the window, I expect a wait, but if they say 30 mins, I do not expect to return and be told another 30 minutes.
*: Used Wal-Mart for nearly a year, go to doctor every 3 months for checkup, and prescription refills. I take 3 meds. My family doctor would fax them to Wal-Mart and I would call and inform them I would come next day to pick up meds. I went 4 times in a year, and not 1 time did they ever have my prescriptions filled even after 24 hours. But 2 of the times they didn't my blood pressure medicine in stock and I would have to wait 2 days for them to get it in stock in order to fill my prescription. I have used CVS, Walgreens with no problems, always filled within an hour. I now use a pharmacy in the same strip mall where my family doctor is located, they walk the prescription over to the pharmacy and usually 15 minutes they have them filled. It is a little more expensive than CVS or Walgreens, but it's 15 miles one way to these name brand pharmacies. So with time and gas, it's more convenient to use a small local pharmacy.
*: Walmart is notorious, for crappie customer service. This includes waiting in line for your pharmacy prescriptions. And then you get up there to cashier to find out it's not ready, they have put it on hold?! What?! So now you have to wait again. Only one cashier?! With 15 people in line?! I hate Walmart.
*: Walmart prices are good, but are constantly changing going up and down. The clerks are usually slow and rude. They will text and say the order is ready and once you drive all the way over there it’s not ready. They even have to call the Dr. I would switch but it’s close to home.
*: This rating is primarily for WAL-MART'S MAIL ORDER PHARMACY. WAL-MART'S $10 for 90 day program has ALWAYS come out a bit ahead of the co-pays I would've paid through my two different insurers, that I had to choose from, for my maintenance medication. I've used the MAIL ORDER SERVICE from one state to another, during a sudden temporary address change and flawlessly my VERY NECESSARY medication followed without a hiccup in time. A+++
*: I have 3 of the pharmacist on first name basically. Due to all my medical reactions to medicines they kind me safe. Every time I refill a script they make sure I take right by discussing it and if I had any issues that may occur by taking it They call the remind me to reorder my scripts so I don't ever run out. They are easy to get to with a drive through I a life saver due to my walking disability. I love my marketplace.
*: The staff is very knowledgeable, polite and courteous. Have never had an issue since we switched about 8 months ago from Rexall which was terrible. When we were with Rexall it got to the point that we would have to wait sometimes 3-4 days for a prescription. Since switching to Wal-Mart. We can drop off a prescription when we enter the store and pick it up within 1/2 to 3/4 of an hour.
*: If my insurance did not mandate that I use this pharmacy, I wouldn't. The old manager Cam was great. He retired and so did their quality. It's bad enough to have to wait for a prescription, but when I've called it in 2 days prior and I still have to wait - that's ridiculous.
*: Wal-Mart Pharmacy in Brunswick Troy NY, is about the greatest pharmacy ever. Jeff and the new young lady pharmacists are so accommodating. No matter how much you call with a question they are more than happy to answer and take their time with you. Would go nowhere else.
*: My pharmacist at Walmart are always friendly and are very knowledgeable. They are my go to folks for info and trust in a medicine. I can ask their advice on OTC drugs as well as prescriptions. They always take the time to know you fully understand. I have always been satisfied with my Walmart pharmacy in Unicoi Tn.
*: We just had to change to Wal-Mart Pharmacy beginning Jan. 1, 2019. So far our initial start up and getting prescriptions transferred has been anything but pleasant. The help cannot seem to get their "act together" with all the information given them and put it into motion. I am hoping that as a few more months pass, things will be better. I do know that the prices we are getting from Wal-Mart are 150 percent better than the prices we got from the independent pharmacy we had used for years. One on prescription alone saved us over three fourths as much as we had been paying. That is very welcomed. So due to the money factor, we will continue to trade at Wal-Mart Pharmacy and pray things improve.
*: I went to Walmart in Memphis Tennessee on Austin Peay Highway. I went to the pharmacy and asked for my ** insulin. The girls saw me waiting and were in no hurry to wait on me. Finally one of them opened the refrigerator, took out a bottle and put it in a sack and handed it to me. You pay for it right then so I put it in my purse got home and put it in my refrigerator. The next day I got it out and looked at it, it was not what I asked for and paid for. I went back to Walmart to get told it was my fault for not looking at it before I walked away and they said no exchange or money back.
*: I was told that my prescription was a Maintenance issue and wasn't a priority, I shouldn't have ran out and since I had, they weren't going to fill it until the next day. I said what since when can you prioritize whose medication you want to fill? Then she said that you can call another store if you want your medicine. I had to call Seagoville pharmacy and they were Ashamed of Kaufman!!! I was so upset that I called back, spoke with store asst manager she went over and said something. Meanwhile mysteriously my prescriptions were ready WITH AN APOLOGY! SAVE YOUR APOLOGIES...YOUR PHARMACY SUCK...AND SO DO YOUR EMPLOYEES...
*: First of all I despise Walmart. I have been waiting all afternoon for a refill on my pain medication. Doctor called in and because it's a controlled substance they can only give me enough for a week. They finally told me this at 8:00pm and I've been in pain all day. Knee replacement. CVS here I come. Also, I admire foreigners who speak our language. I can't theirs. But, please please hire those that speak more clearly.
*: I recently broke a tooth and went to Walmart to have a prescription filled for a pain pill because a tooth was hurting me very badly. I waited for 2 and 1/2 hours in pain, for them to fill my prescription just for them to tell me that they were completely out of my pain medication.
*: My husband was given a 30 day script from the doctor for a recurring back injury. He went to the Walmart Pharmacy to fill said script. They called him when it was filled with a price of $31.00. Then, he gave them the insurance information. Walmart tech told him that he could only fill a 7 day script. Walmart policy, they said. We explained that the doctor wrote the script for 30 days. We then called the insurance company. They said that the script is covered for 30 days; but, Krishna (the pharmacist) decided to only fill 7 days and the other 21 days would be lost. In other words, go back to the doctor for another script. 
*: I have been filling prescriptions at Walmart for years. This time last year, I refilled an available prescription online, got the email saying they were filling it, and then went to pick it up, and they said they had no record of the prescription or me requesting to fill it. After a few frustrated calls to my insurance and the pharmacy themselves, I ended up requesting the doctor's office to send a refill to the pharmacy. No problems again, until today. 
*: I brought 5 routine prescriptons to WalMart and asked for the cost of getting them filled.  The prescriptions were for high blood pressure, high cholestrol, and high sugar.  The assistant asked me to return in about 15 minutes.  When I returned she said it would be about $85 to get them filled.  I asked her to fill them.  When I got home I found that out of the 5 prescriptions written for 90 day quantities, 4 of the five were only filled for 30 days.  
*: While I have had more than one experience with customer UN-service at our local Walmart, today I decided to kiss Walmart goodbye.  While I do save on prices, the gas to make repeated trips for prescriptions (only to find them not filled) I've decided the trip just isn't worth the gas anymore.  I plan to shop in my home downtown. 
*: Why do we have to wait two hours sometime and today 30 minutes when I called in the prescription yesterday.  They decided they were going to lunch while four people were in line. We then had to wait  Why can't the two girls (clerks)just alternate with the prescriptions already in packets? I am all for eating, but alternate the employees please. 
*: Each Month I went to the parmacy due to a stroke My memory doesnt serve me well so I cant remember things with a large number of refills.  Each month I came home with less and less meds. When I asked them to help me They said I have to order by Name.  I asked them to look them up in the computer I could tell them what each pill was for but not the proper name!  They refused! Thanks for nothing! 
*: They refused to do a refill with out 24 hour notice for an over the road trucker.  I was home for less than 24 hours and when I walked in there I was turned away!  Now I am back on the road with out my meds for High Blood presure.
*: I am a sufferer of Chronic Daily Headaches; diagnosed two years ago in August, 2006. My chronic pain doctor has me on several medications to try and keep the headaches to where I can function with moderate pain on a daily basis. One of the meds that I take daily is **, a narcotic pain medication that is a relative to **. My insurance will only pay for my medications every 30 days, and there are time that I may run out of my ** a few days early. The reason for this is because there are days I have migraines that are worse than a regular daily headache and cause me to have take more ** to keep the pain under control. My doctor is aware that I sometimes have to take more than what my directions call for on these painful days and directs me to do as I need to stay as pain-free as possible.
*: I have lived in a lot of states and towns and always preferred Wal-Mart pharmacies to any other. I have recently moved to Junction City, KS and on MANY occasions there has been a problem with prescriptions not being ready when called and was told they was, and with knee surgery having to be in a line for literally 4 hours. This last and recent time was the last straw. I am highly addicted to ** and was needing withdrawal meds because I wanted no part of being on that drug, I dropped it off at 5pm. The pharmacy closes at 7. I was not happy that they didn't have enough help as usual to fill it for me going thru horrible withdrawals but was reassured they would have it done by 10am the next morning.
*: I take a certain controlled medication due to having an extreme amount of rods, pins, plates, screws, and bolts in my leg.  The dosage if my prescription is 2 tablets 3 times a day, which is 180 tablets per month.  My medications are costly each month so I work 2 jobs to pay for insurance to help with this burden.  Upon having this prescription fill yesterday  I noticed when I returned home that the medication bottle wasn't the same size that I normally receive.  I counted the tablets and discovered that I was 100 tablets short, I was only given 80.  I called the pharmacy right away to explain the problem and was told to bring all my medications back to the Thomas ville store, which I did.

*: My wife is sick and in pain, so today we went to Walmart to drop off a perscription, and was told that they were closing for lunch, but to please come back in today for pickup.  When we called to double check when their pharmacy closed, I myself was told at 8:00pm, so living about 20 minutes away, I got there as fast as I could being 7:13 already!  I made it there in plenty of time. Only to find that the pharmacy was already closed!  
*: I get all my medications at Wal-Mart pharmacy in Chillicothe, Mo.  I have had several problems with them.  The most recent being, I called my meds in on Saturday, reason being that I had just went through my pills to fill my weekly supply.  The lady on the phone told me I might want to call back on Monday, why I was calling them in on Saturday, not to be picked up right then but so they could have them ready and waiting. 
*: I had a staph infection and took in 2 prescriptions for antibiotics. I was given 1 antibiotic and an anti depression medication. I am bipolar and I have my meds regulated at this time. Had I not contacted the dr the next day I could have gotten all messed up taking the wrong meds. The dr was beside himself that the pharmacy gave me ** instead of **. He instructed me to immediately stop taking the ** to avoid having my system messed up and the risk of suicide and many other possible side effects.
*: My meds were due to be filled on the fifteenth. I called in my meds and was ask if there were any I needed right away, I said my heart pills, when I went to pick up all my meds they didn't have heart meds and said they didn't know I needed them, {when I was on the phone I told them I only had two days left,and that was on the 12th} I had to go back the next day, and was told they only had enough for 3 days, I was told they would have the rest in three days, I went back on friday and they said they had to order them and they would be in on monday, 
*: My mother was just dischard from the hospital and like always we go to wal mart to fill her perscriptions. When we got there we gave them to them and they said about one hour wait. We said does mom have to be here? They said no. So my sister took her home. Then they aske me what the Dr.,s name was because they could'nt read his name. So I called my sister to get the correct spelling of his name. I told them what it was and then they said I couldn't get them till Monday. But Mom needed them to take at bedtime. So they said the perscripition would be 100.00 plus. I said I don't care because she has to have them. Then she said Mom's insurance has been canceled. So I got 5 pills till Monday. 
*: My doctor called in a new pherscription at 11 a.m. Igave them 4 hours to get it ready then went to pick it up and waqs told that in store customers have first rights and I would have to wait 25 min.  I talked to Customer Service supervisor and they said ther has been a few complaints and she was sorry but nothing she could do.  I was upset so I told them next time I would go to the Wal-Mart in Sparta, Ill. on Rt. 4.  
*: I used to think that only Coffeyville, Kansas Wal-Mart had service issues until I moved to Idaho. My father who always got his medicine from Wal-Mart every month went to pick up his RX and was given my grandfather's (his father's) meds. A mistake that could happen to anyone except my grandfather died in 1989. Then after moving to our new state I went to have a RX filled for my migraines. I realize that if you don't know anyone who suffers from migraines or have them yourself you might not realize that taking to ** and going to bed wont work. However, the pharmacy, after accepting the prescription call in from my doctor did not have the ** that my doctor ordered. I waited with my head pounding for over an hour to be told that they would have it in on Saturday. This was Wednesday. 
*:    I was waiting in line for my prescriptions were being filled. A girl with the name tag of Jen had just completed filling someone elses medication. She dropped one on the floor, picked it up and placed it in the stock bottle and back on the shelf. One of the other female employee's  was wiping her nose and pushing her hair back, then would handle medications with her hands without washing them.  I have been a nurse for 26 years and this is unethical. I'm sure that it is also against state health regulations. No physical damage done. This is just unethical, unsanitary,and should not be allowed to happen. I can check with the State Health Department to confirm my theory.
*: I just came across this website, I thought I would let people know what happen to me when I went to my local Wal-Mart pharmacy. I have never been so mad at someone, like I was at this pharmacy. I took my Grandmother to get her medicine for panic and anxiety attack. She takes **. She really needs them since her husband died. I walk with her over there to drop her medicine off, and we walk around while it was getting ready. She went over there to get her medicine and the lady pharmacy was very rude to her. Telling her that she didn't need to be taking this medicine and it was addictive. Well, Who is she to tell my grandmother anything. Her doctor wants her to take this medicine. As if the doctor was wrong and didn't know what he was doing. 
*:   I had a prescription which I specifically told the women at the counter that one drug company in particular was not effective.  I asked if another drug company by name could be ordered.  The women took the piece of paper to the female pharmacist at Walmart and when she came back she said they could fill it.  When I picked up the presciption it was for the company I specifically asked not to have.
*: At 5:05pm My wife and I approached the prescription drop off window,10 minutes later we were acknowledged( after 4 different associates passed by the window avoiding eye contact). We then were told there would be a 1hr wait. We were fine with that. ALMOST TWO HOURS LATER! My wife had went on home with the kids to start dinner and I was there beinig ignored once more. When I finally got somone to help me I was informed that they only had one of the two medications in stock and it would be tomorow. What ever happened to common courtesy? Somone could have let me know sooner. I may have been able to make it to another Pharmacy before they closed. The entire staff of the Wetumpka Walmart Pharmacy needs to be replaced with people who actually know what they are doing and care about the people they are serving. 
*: The Pharmacy refued to accept my debit card ( which is the same as cash ) to pay for a blood thinner prescription  that was needed in an emergency situation for my brother who can not afford to pay for his medication.  He is unemployed.  He has had a stroke and  very ill.  
*: Out of all the pharmacist at this particular Wal-Mart, I have found ONLY ONE - Patrick - who is helpful.  However, he works only during the week.  My doctor made the decision to switch the dates of my regular medications from th 15th to the 10th, my insurance WOULD pay. I discussed this earlier during the week with Patrick and was assured there would be no problem. However, when I went this morning (10th) to refill my meds, the pharmacist there REFUSED, saying I would have to have a doctor call and state it was okay to fill it today. 
*: Went to Walmart today to get 3 RX filled. I have been getting RX's filled at the Lisbon, CT Wal-mart for 6 years.  I asked about 1 RX because they did not have it in stock last time and I had to get the script back and get it filled at CVS.  This time they had it in stock and told me 30 min.  
*: I went to the pharmacy to pick up a rx that I had called around 740 pm to find out if it was ready, I told the girl I was on my way and when I got there it was 755 pm (they close at 8)and they were just pulling down the window.  I tried to explain (thru the glass window because no one would talk to me) that my son was at home with a fever of 103 and needed this medicine and they told me no, they would not give it to me because they were closed.  This is the 2nd time I have had someone literally close the window in my face and tell me to come back.

This is the 2nd time I have had someone literally close the window in my face and tell me to come back.  
*: I moved to Georgia from Tennesse a few weeks ago. I had a bad toothache so I went to the dentist and he gave me ten pain pills(** - 500MG) for my pain which was for a few days. I hurt my back and went to the local urgent care center and the doctor there gave me some more pain meds. I also had some other medicine for back. I took my medicine to Wal-Mart to get filled. I have Medicaid and they told me that they could fill my **, but I had to wait until tomorrow for my pain medicine, since I just had a prescription a few days ago for my tooth.
*: Went to get two prescriptions filled for wife. One in 45 minutes, great. Theother would be ready the next day, okay no problem. WQent back to same store this noon pharmaacy closed for lunch 12:30 to 1:30 Okay. Got in line at 1;20, got to window at 2:00. Told there was a problem with the remaining one and go to the first window and find out. Again, no problem just disappointed that it was to be ready first thing, but okay. 
*: I am very sick with Hepatitis C3. The hospital told me to go to my doctor and get a prescription for **. I called and was told that I had to bring in the prescription. They said they could not tell me if they had it in stock over the phone. I took in the prescription and was told they were old. They would not have it in until Friday. They would not have the prescription until Friday. They would not return my prescription in until Friday. I am in extreme pain and need the prescription. I feel they should be able to get it sometime after else. I am in extreme pain. I feel they should they should have let me know so I can it filled elsewhere.
*: Doctor's office called pharmacy on Friday to get cost of medication...$10 for one month.  Took perscription in on Monday it was 52.68 okay....it was not in the store but was quoted to me for 2 weeks and full script...Ms.Fischer said to come back on Tuesday to pick up the 2 weeks. She said to be sure and call her (gave me her card) before coming. I called and it would be ready when I got there.  The price on Tuesday was $104.  Well, the computer updated last night and the  price was changed.  
*: I phoned in a monthly prescription to Walmart last week (on 3/22/08). The next day, I woke up with a bad fever and cough. By the end of the day I was seriously ill. I was unable to pick up my re-order for a week.  After a week, I went into Walmart (still very sick) and wearing a medical mask to prevent infecting others with VIRAL PNEUMONIA. I had just been released from the hospital.  I stood in the Pick-Up Line at pharmacy for over 15 minutes. I finally got to the window and the tech asked for my name etc. I told her. She did not seem to understand me, and asked how to spell my name several times. I told her several times.  She said in an extremely rude manner We have NOTHING for you! When I said that I had phoned it in last week, she said in a loud and angry voice, "BY LAW WE HAVE TO RETURN ALL MEDICATIONS TO SHELF AFTER 7 DAYS."   
*: I was taking my wife home from the hospital and they had faxed the prescriptions ahead of time but when I got there I was told it would take 15 min. 30 min later they still hadn't gotten it done. Their customer service was horrible and all this while my wife suffered from a pneumonia! Walgreens is 100x better.
*: I was at the Pharmacy on March 5th of 08 and was picking up my sons med's that we have been picking up for a year now. When we did, they gave it to a new customer. He is in the computer system so if you get a new customer then reorder them there meds. I go get my son's and they have to reorder mine and it will take 5 days. He needs them daily or he doesn't do well in school or have control. I'm just very unhappy. When they look things up they should know how many customers use that same meds and as I can see they only have 2 of us, I know it's a drug you don't keep on hand but for a year you know. What makes me unhappy is they gave me a extra 30 pills one month and I was nice enough to bring them back and this is how I'm treated.
*: They gave a lady the wrong medication and then had the nerve to say, oops. They charged me full price for my medication and I have insurance and should only pay a copay. They overcharged me seventy dollars and it was that same woman, "oops I am just crazy". If you take back something without a receipt three times in a year they will not give you your money back or a card for the amount for a year! Just found this out. They will not give you money back on food with out a receipt. You can ask to see one of the pitiful managers here and ask to exchange (doesn't mean you  will get it). They have none of this posted! 
*: First, I brought in a prescription for my husband and since he doesn't have insurance, I proceeded to use my AAA card for the discount.  The clerk had no idea how to enter it into the computer, consequently I could not use the AAA card. Fortunately it was not an expensive one.  All the clerks should be trained on how to enter the AAA discounts.  
*: I shop in the Bidderford, ME and Jupiter, FL pharmacies. On scale of 1-10, with 10 best--Maine is a 12 and FL, a 2. When Doctors don't want to call in or call consumers phone to get get service, WE HAVE A PROBLEM. As a customer and stockholder, I think this issue should be addressed. Thanks
*: First Off I want to say that their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. They always seem to be out of merchandise that is on roll back. The Managers there do not seem to go out of there way to help, they pass everything off on the people who work there. The Pharmacy is the worst I have ever been to. There has been several times I needed my meds filled and every time it took more than two hours. I have even tried calling ahead of time and would be told it would be ready in 30 minutes, I get there and had to wait another 1hr. It is crazy that a Multi Billion company who is the leading retail company in the world cannot have better service than they do. I go to the smaller Pharmacies now and I am in and out in 15 min. I will never go to Wal-mart Pharmacy again.
*: Took in a prescription and was told it would take about 30 minutes, which was fine because I was able to get my hair cut. After an hour and half, it still wasn't filled.  This is Saturday and only one pharmacist working. Another lady was trying to find my prescription and to no avail. Talked to the pharmacist and she finally found mine and stated to me and about 15 other customers that she had about 48 others to fill before mine and we are talking about another two hours.  She looked at my script and stated I could have a seat, very hatefully, as I wasn't going to die. I was so embarrassed and several other customers stated they had been treated the same way today. The only reason I went to Walmart was because my doctor said my script would be $4.00 compared to $100 plus.  I do my business at Rite-Aid with great customer service.
*: On February 23, 2008, I went to The Wal-mart pharmacy in Lehigh Acres, FL to asked about my prescription. The pharmacist assistant was very nasty to me. While she asked for my information, I could see that she was disgusted to talk to me; she never look at me when she was talking to me. This happened three times, and all three times this lady at the same. The fourth time I went to talk to the pharmacist; all he has to say was "If you don't like our services, go somewhere else!" He also said that because I did not pick up my medicine fast enough, he was taking it off the computer.
*: I went to Wal-Mart Pharmacy and picked up my son's Medicine on 1/14/2008. I didn't think I had to check the dates. On 2/26/2008, I happen to look at the date on the bottle and it read: expires 12/2007. The other bottles had stickers over the expiration dates. When I peel the stickers off, I was unable to read them because part of it came off with the stickers. Now I wonder if my medication is expired because they put it in a yellow pill bottle and they put an Drug Exp. on it. On my son's bottle they have on their label that they printed out and put on, reads: Drug Exp. 01/13/2009 and on the bottle itself reads: Exp. 12/2007. Now what date do you trust? I am going by the date on the bottle itself. 
*: I dropped off my blood pressure prescription for a refill on Feb.21, 2008 about 4:15pm. I was told it would be ready by 6pm that day. I laughed, knowing that if I got it by 9 it would be because the earth was going to end. I went home planning to pick it up the next day. I got there at 4:20 on Feb.22, 2008. After waiting until 5.pm was told they could only give 3 out of the 30. I was never told they were low on stock the day before. I told them that 3 would not do, because I am to take 2 per day by my doctor's advice. The pharmacist came out and was rude, told me that he didn't care what the doctor told me that the prescription said 1 per day, then told me I was not the only person to take that drug. I told him to cancel it and I would go to another store. He shrugged and went back to his throne. 
*: I went to pick up medicine for my mother that I ordered over the phone on Feb 12 and when I tried to pick it up they informed me it was put back on the shelf. When I complained, they told me they could have it ready in 5 min. 23 min. later they finally brought it to me the bottle was a sealed bottle that they didn't have to count it - all they had to do was slap a label on it and hand it to me. Then that same day I ordered something else for my mom and when I got there to pick it up there were 32 people in front of me with ONE cashier.
*: I went to pick up my migraine prescription.  I get 6 pills for $40.00.  I was told they only had 3 and I would still have to pay the $40.00.  I could come back when they got more in, but I would have to pay another $40.00.     I called my insurance company and they said this had nothing to do with them, that they paid for the number of pills that the prescription was written for.      Needless to say, I transferred my script to another pharmacy in town.
*: The pharmacy gave me someone else's prescription.  This was a Sunday evening.  We discovered the mistake at 6:15 p.m. and went back to the pharmacy to get the correct prescription and return the wrong one.  The pharmacy closed at 6:00 p.m.  I asked the customer service desk to get in touch with the pharmacist and have him/her come back to the store to correct the problem, as my son was out of his medication and needed to have it the next morning.  The pharmacist refused to come back that evening and said that I would have to come back the next morning when the pharmacy reopened.  I found this response to be totally unacceptable.  This mistake was pure negligence.  
*: I took my daughter in law on 02/12/08, about 11:00 am, to get her prenatal vitamins refilled. We were told we'd have to pick them up after 11:00 am on 02/13/08 because they were so behind. On the 13th, we got there after 11 am and the man told us it'd be three hours. Then he ask us to speak to this other lady and she said she'd have them in 15 minutes. We walked around and came back in 20 minutes and talked to another lady who said it'd be 30 minutes longer. After a while she did get her vitamins. This man in front of us had gone to the doctor and the doctor had called in his prescription on Monday. This was Wednesday and they still did not have it ready. A friend of mine carried his daughter to the doctor and had to leave the prescription because they were so far behind and when he went back the next day, they said they didn't have the medicine in stock. 
*: I brought in a RX about noon on Friday, came back to pick it up about 5 PM that day but the line for pick-ups was so long I left. I went back this evening, stood in line about half an hour before I was waited on, then I was told WE DON'T HAVE THAT ITEM, IT WILL HAVE TO BE ORDERED, BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT UNTIL MONDAY. WHY WHY did they not order it when they could fill the RX? I am looking for a new place to buy my RX.
*: Wal-Mart must not care anymore for anyone's business in the Pharmacy. On 3 separate trips to the pharmacy the waiting period for medication has been more than 2 1/2 hours or more. The first problem we had on a Friday afternoon after waiting on the bench for 2 1/2 hours for what they did the order was not completely filled and when husband arrived at home found that some had been completely left out causing us to have to drive more than 20 miles to go back to store for medication needed.
*: 
*: My wife called her prescription in to WalMart. When I went to pick up her medicine, the pharmacist gave us the wrong medicine. It was not realized until my wife had almost taken the pill that it was the wrong medicine. My wife is on a lot of medication right now. Is there any thing that can be done about this? 
*: During a recent trip to Walmart Pharmacy, I was written a prescription for a generic version of **. My fiance had to pick that up and the pharmacy didn't offer the dosage that was written out by my dr. In the past they have always called the dr instead of fill the prescription. This time they didn't do that, they filled it with the regular ** which was $76.68. The prescription the dr wrote me was not for this medicine but all they could say was it wasn't their fault.
*: I have had to many bad experiences at the pharmacy. I called with a transfer for them to do. This was about 11am. I came in at 5:45pm and dropped another script off. I was told it would be thirty minutes. When I came back up, I was informed that they never called for the transfer and my other med was not filled. This happens quite frequently and I am put in a line that takes 20-30 mins to get through. I am getting close to removing my business from the store. I have never been treated this bad before.
*: I filled my normal prescription of ** 5mg tablets on 12/05/07. I have filled this same prescription at the same store on 3 previous occasions with NO issues. On 12/5 I took a pill -it tasted different, I became very sick (vertigo like symptoms), and developed hives/swelling on my hands/arms. The symptoms passed - I took a second pill - no problems at all. I figured it was a fluke reaction. Before bed, I take my 3rd pill of the day (still 12/05). Funny taste and same bad reaction. I dumped all the pills out and noticed that there were about 10 pills that had different ID numbers (everything else was identical). I call the pharmacy to tell them about the ID number difference and about the side effects I am having.
*: First off I sent my granddaughter to get many different prescriptions. I had just gotten out of rehab and can hardly walk. One of those prescriptions were a narcotic, **. My prescription was for 60 ** and I received 38. 22 were missing. When I caught the mistake as soon as I got my meds, I called them and asked them about it; all the pharmacist had to say was someone outside their pharmacy had stolen some. The bag had not been opened throughout the transfer. 
*: On November, 20, 2007, I went to fill my pain medication that my doctor had called in. I realized I was filling it a day early, only because we were going out of state for the Thanksgiving holiday. I was advised by this pharmacist that I could not have it because the insurance would not fill it and I explained the only reason I was filling it early was because of the holiday. I even offered to pay for enough to get me through the weekend and she said I could not because of it being a controlled substance, which still didn't make sense to me. I would think I would have the right to pay for my own medication or run it through my insurance. She then assured me it could be filled at another Walmart as it could be transferred once. However, what she didn't do is inquire as to what state I would be going to to make certain what the laws in that state are. In the state of Texas, a controlled substance prescription can't be transferred without the actual prescription. Walmart had actually filled the prescription and no longer had the orginal. This second pharmacist, before faxing anything, should of verified with the Walmart in Austin, TX. I even gave him their phone number. So now I know I'm not going to get home in time to get my pain medication, so I called Walgreens in Joplin, MO because they are a 24 hour pharmacy and  Walmart tells Walgreens this can't be transferred because it's been transferred to Walmart in Texas. I can't get in touch with my doctor because it's a holiday weekend. They have totally messed this prescription up. 
*: This Walmart pharmacy employs rude, incompetent employees and is a most unprofessional pharmacy. After being told it would take 45 minutes for my prescription, I waited 2 hours to then be told it's still not ready. When I asked for the actual prescriptions back, they literally had to root through the trash to retrieve them. I think some English speaking employees might have helped, but none were there. 
*: My doctor sent in a refill to walmart because it was the request of my company. First, as I stood in this unnecessary  line I watched some disgusting lady sneeze and wipe her nose and drink a soda while filling prescriptions with bare hands.  The girl that was cashing out looked as though she was having a nervous breakdown by leaving the register to go to the back and ask the sneezer to watch the register.  No one had on any form of uniform and then it was my turn. 
*: I went to pick my prescription from Walmart this evening 11/5/07. My prescription was ready, and the guy at the register said it was $137.36. I was surprised because the same prescription was usually $48.00. They had done a 90-day supply instead of a 30-day supply. I asked if they could change it to a 30-day supply because this was almost $100.00 more than I was prepared to pay. He ask the pharmacist if I could get it changed. Her response was (NO EYE CONTACT AND IN A VERY DISGUSTED TONE OF VOICE) she'll have to wait because we'll have to do the whole process over. They did not give me a time as to when it would be ready, very unconcerned or caring!
*: I was waiting in line at Walmart to pick up a prescription that had been called in two days prior. The clerk made 5 other people and me stand in line, waiting, while she was upset with someone not responding to her call right away.  After our waiting for 15 minutes, she shut the window down and said she was going to lunch.  Could she not tell us when we were standing there that she was not going to wait on us?  This is a frequent ordeal with this pharmacy.  I have been there 3 times, and every time there has been a bad experience.  When I asked for the manager I was told he doesn't get involved with these ordeals and to call 479-273-8800 ext 52224. I have tried three times to call this long distance number only to receive no response.  They will never have to worry about me or my family shopping there again.
*: I did not realize until later that evening when I was in the process of taking the medication that it was not mine. It was for another person and medical issue unrelated to me. Luckily I noticed the medication was different before taking it, who knows what might have happened. When I contacted the pharmacy I got a half hearted I'm sorry and to please return the incorrect medication to them and they would have my correct prescription ready when I came in. My concern is for others who may not be so lucky and take the improper medication with bad consequences or even death....is this happening a lot at Walmart Pharmacies?
*: After seeing a major network news program talking about a certain medication newly added to Wal-Mart's $4 prescription drug list, I found it to be actually $9. This particular medication, **, a birth control pill, is in fact listed on the Wal-Mart website under Women's Health medications which have recently been added to the $4 list. On that list, which at the top says $4 prescriptions, just above several medications listed, in fine print, is a statement that these particular prescriptions sell for $9. I feel that this is extremely misleading and smacks of false advertising.
*: My husband, Frank **, is a patient on treatment for Hepatitis C, taking ** and an experimental drug. He is very ill. He has ulcers in his mouth and had fallen down the stairs and was trying to get his prescriptions filled on 10/10/07 at the pharmacy. He is very sick from the chemo like treatment and in pain from the fall down the stairs. There was something wrong with the prescription and he felt that the person waiting on him was rude. So he insisted on speaking with a manager. The pharmacy clerk refused to allow him to speak to a manager or supervisor and proceeded to argue with my husband. The customer, my husband, yelled at the pharmacy clerk. The clerk got the pharmacist and the pharmacist told my husband he could purchase the drugs or get out of the store.
*: 
*: 
*: On Thursday, 9/6/07, at 3:00 PM, I went to return an package of ** that I purchased on 9/4/07. At the time of purchase, I had to give my driver's license and signature for the item (due to improper use by drug dealers). The package was put directly into a bag and stapled with the receipt attached. When I got home to use the item, I noticed that the expiration date was 10/07 code #B53963, meaning that the item was about to expire and the strength of the medication would not be powerful, especially since this type of medication does not get used-up immediately.

*: My daughter and I ran by Walmart on Thursday 02/08/07 night at 10:00pm to pick up a few items. When I went to check out there were only 1 lane open. The line of customers was extremely long(approx.15 customers waiting.) When I approached two staff emp. (1-sorting items in baskets & another in customer service laughing on what appeared to be a personal call). No one could tell me where the manager could be found. I then spoke with Nancy (floor supervisor) who was closing out.   My actual time in line 26 minutes. I understand that there are fewer employees on the night shift, my complaint is there were Walmart staff who were standing and chatting with each other, that could have helped. Several customers did get irritated, set their items on shelf and walked out empty handed.
*: Rich, is one of the managers who continued to harass me, they give people hours and then they make them cut it, to keep from giving the overtime, now some people get overtime if they are nice. Then Walmart came out with this new attendance policy which will eliminate people by the day and by the night saying that people cannot have mergencies
*: When I signed up for the Medicare Drug Program one year ago there was a young female pharmacist working there and I got excellent service. I ordered my inhalers and they were mailed out to me in a timely manner. I was completely satisfied with my service. Mailing is a convenient option since I live 52 miles from the Walmart Pharmacy in Prescott. Then my medicine was not mailed and I had to go without my inhaler for several days. I did try to pick it and the pharmacist named Chuck was rude and insensitive stating that it was already mailed then and it would cost me $180 to fill another at that time. I chose not to do that. Everyone makes mistakes but when it happened the second time and I called to see where my prescription was they told me it was waiting there for pick up in spite of the fact that directions are in the computer for mailing out. So again, I am without medication for two days.
*: Went to the pharmacy to drop off 3 perscriptions for my daughter to have filled they were for insulin and syringes. I gave the perscription slips to the person taking them at the time and told the young man that this person does not have health insurance to let them know I was paying cash for the medication. The time I dropped them off was 7:00 pm.  He told me it would take forty minutes.  
*: Walmart Pharmacy only provided 90 pills instead of 180 on a three-month Medicare refill. When I called to have the order properly filled, I was told that (a) I must have lost the pills (b ) Walmart doesnt make mistakes and (c) I would have to pay for the missing pills if I wanted them.
*: 
*: Recently I transferred an online prescription from Costco to Walmart, with the new prices I was hoping to save money. On the 4th day of transferring, I went to Walmart, stood in there half hour to 1 hour line. The girl couldn't find the prescription. She told me it had just now popped up. I said after 4 days it is just now popping up? Strange, so I said I would pick it up tomorrow. Next night I went back to Walmart, stood in the line (at least there was only 3 of us) stood another 30 minutes, this time the girl sends me to the pharmacist, he asks me what I needed, how do I know what I needed, she just sent me there. 
*: The doctor's office called in an Rx for my 3 year old daughter for ** at 5:00 pm so that we would be assured that she would begin the med in the required 24 hr period. When we arrived at the pharmacy 2 hours later it was still not ready because they said they were missing her birthdate and decided not to fill the Rx. We had our other daughter's Rx filled there 2 days prior so all our info was in the computer. When we arrived they said they would now process it and it would be ready in about 2 hours at which time we phoned and were told it would not be ready until morning. 
*: While on vacation in Illinois visiting relatives, I took a prescription to Wal-Mart for my 4 month old daughter and they gave her the WRONG medication! The doctor gave her an allergy med because she allergic to kitty cats. So, I took it to get it filled and I remembered the Dr telling me it was a nasal drop med. Well, they gave her 5mg ** an adult allergy medicine. Why? Because the pharmacist guessed (her words) at what it was supposed to be!!!! We unfortunately didn't catch this until we had already given her a half of their dosage. They had it written out to give her a tablespoon! 
*: There is a serious problem at this particular Wal-Mart pharmacy (Mt. Sterling KY) of people getting shorted on their prescriptions. Several months ago my aunt had heart surgery and had to have some very expensive medicine afterward. She could only afford to buy the pills 10 at a time.
*: The Paragould Wal-Mart has no organization. I went to have a prescription filled on 2/8/03, couldn't due to insurance block until the 10th, was told it will be filled on 2/10/03 and in line to be filled that day. Dropped by there at 445pm and prescription was not filled. 3 other times in last 4 months, I called to have a prescription filled and to be picked up at my lunch hour. I double-checked when I called to see when it would be ready and when I did go to pick up prescription(s) they were not ready when the clerk said they would be.I have only a 30 minute lunch and just wanted to drop in and out and get my business done. I couldn't. At time my primary insurance would not fill a prescription and I asked the staff to put it on my file that if primary wont accept to run it through secondary and when I have gone to the pharmacy to pick up my prescription at the designated time I was told it would be ready I have found the prescription not filled because my secondary insurance was not even checked. This is the only Wal-Mart Pharmacy I have found to be disorganized. I compliment the staff at both the Bryant and Sheridan Wal-Marts for their professionalism.
*: On 1-2-02 I had a prescription filled at this Wal-Mart pharmacy. I was over the limit on the items in my cart to check out, so the pharmacy scanned my prescription for me to check out in the store. When I got home, my prescription bag was not in any of my Wal-Mart bags. I called the store, and they traced the cashier from the receipt; they said it would be turned back into the pharmacy, called back the next day, no prescription been returned.Then I was told I would get a refund, bring back the receipt. I sent my husband with the receipt, he was told we had to talk to Chris, the manager today, I talked with him, and he says they are not responsible once the prescription leaves the store. Since it didn't leave the store, since they never gave it to me, I certainly think they are responsible. 
*: I never get my prescriptions filled at Walmart but considering ** is a one time fill and I was at Walmart shopping I decided to drop my prescription off and have it filled while I shopped. Well that was a mistake. 1st of all it took a lot longer to fill than they originally said so I said I would come back and get it tomorrow. Well I ended up in the hospital for almost a week and then for another week after that was having a hard time recuperating and did not go anywhere. I called Walmart pharmacy once I was feeling better and they said they had restocked my prescription because it had been more than 9 days and they would have to refill it. When I went to get it the pharmacist told me that because it was a narcotic and it was a first time fill I would only get 7 days' supply and in the process of waiting for the rest of my prescription they would be calling my doctor to make sure that I should have this prescription. 
*: I recently moved an hour away from the Walmart where I had my scripts for years. I have severe RA and for 5 months now have been dealing with a very aggressive anterolateral impingement of the left knee for which I received a very minimal narcotic script of only 20 tablets. I didn't even require the medicine but every couple of months, from the Same physician and the same exact strength and dosage. When I moved I transferred my scripts from one Walmart store to another, and as everyone knows they all use the same computer records.
*: I had the first shingles vaccine in Sept at Walmart. They said I should get the second shot in two months. Went back over and over and they said they didn't have the second vaccine but would call me when it gets in. I received a letter from Walmart saying I needed to go and get the second shot which is needed within 2-6 months from second shot. It has been 4 months. I went in today with the letter and they said they had the second shot. Since it was Jan 2 - my prescription insurance started over and they said I would have to pay 3 times as much as I did on the first one. I asked them if they had this shot for awhile and they said they did. They didn't call me and I could have gotten the shot at the price of the first one. Since I am on a strict budget, I was not able to get the shot today. Evidently they won't be getting any more until August and so getting the first shot was a waste for me because without the second shot it does not protect.
*: Pharmacy closes 6pm. Urgent care doctor rushed us out so that we can fill prescription before pharmacy closes. He apparently knew it closes at that time. Got to window at 5:36pm but was told to come back tomorrow because it was too late! REALLY! She was very rude & unapologetic still after pleading my case telling her my wife was in a lot of pain (had just broken a foot). She didn't care. Her response, "take your prescription to CVS". I did do that. The next morning the pharmacist there filled it in 10 minutes! Boycotting Walmart pharmacy!
*: Hwy 31 Hartselle, AL 35640 - I came in with a prescription for **. The line on the prescription subtitled Substitution Permitted was signed. Nonetheless they wanted to charge $29 for **, rather than $4 for the substitute ** which is on the $4 list. I took the bus and the round trip ended up taking about 2 hours. I won't do that again.
*: Every month they treat me like crap as soon as they see what I'm filling. They refused to fill it in till I showed them my MRI. In front of everybody I felt so embarrassed and violated. Everyone around me was listening. They have the biggest attitudes then keep changing rules. I can't fill over 120. They never never have it so I have to go elsewhere. Guess what. Next month they tell me I can't do that. I have to wait a week till they get theirs in. I called my Dr. and pharmacy board. Both told me, "As long as you are on time you have every right to go to who has your meds. You could die if you abruptly stop taking those meds." Think they care. They don't care to help, offer a solution. Just act like, "What? You can't wait a week in pain?" Don't dare ask anything. The pharmacist was name Jade **. NV. My Dr got her fired but I'm sure all they did was move her to another store. She should not be at any. Everybody on pain relief is not a drug addict.
*: Last month I stopped at the closest Walmart to drop off my prescription to be filled as I was leaving town. Waited 20 minutes then the pharmacist calls me over & says he called my pain management dr and he didn’t know I was being prescribed **. I told him that was untrue because I’m drug tested every 3-4 months. He also said something about needing a diagnosis code for why I take. Luckily I took my prescription back, went to both of the drs involved and was told by the pain dr all his patient's meds were not being filled even with diagnosis. I took it to the Walmart I have been using since they opened and it was filled in 10 minutes. Fast forward a month. Yesterday I called to get my ** refill because it wasn’t showing up online. I had picked it up in November and had 2 refills. I was ask when I needed it and I said a couple of days will be fine. 
*: I have used Walmart for yrs. This week the Pharm refused to fill my Rx until he rec'd the diagnosis from the MD. Note they have been filling same dose for last 5 mos. No consideration of withdrawal, no assessment of symptoms. My MD basis my medication doses on not just my Rx, but also my symptoms. He refused to ever fill a script for me again because I asked him if he would just start writing my scripts. Why pay for MD visit if pharmacist can do it?
*: I have been to multiple Walmart Pharmacies to fill my prescriptions. I've been very upfront about needing my medication to be name brand and not the generic versions. The generic version they give me is so bad that I might as well not be taking it at all. My scripts have the DAW order specially written on it by my physician. Walmart continuously ignores this order and my requests. I'm afraid if I don't accept the generic medication they try to give me instead, I won't be able to get my script back and will be left without medication of any kind. The one time I checked my medication during the consult and brought up the DAW order, I was told I had to take the generic version or I was not getting any medication and not getting my script back. I don't know what to do at this point. I may need to start videotaping the entire interaction even though I find this incredibly annoying and rude to do to somebody.
*: Walmart pharmacy Homosassa Fl is a nightmare. Current example for antibiotic called in by my Doctor. First claimed she never called in this med - I have her voicemail confirming the time & location she did phone RX, second I had the on-call Dr call back to get this antibiotic - they claimed they rec'd the call but could not fill RX because they didn’t get the Doctor's first name??!! WTH. Third - just called. Pharmacist glibly replies “NOPE, no antibiotic has been filled“. On my way to the ER!
*: I've been a regular customer of the main store for years, my parents have been Rx customers their entire lives - a few weeks ago I went to pick up my mom's prescriptions for her. She has crippling arthritis and can't get around well, so she needed me to pick them up. Not only did they not have her scripts ready, but they had NO record of the phone call that they had made the week prior telling her she needed a refill. And then the pharmacist argued that she had no prescriptions ready and that everything related to her pain and mental health were too soon to fill. 
*: I have been filling my family's prescriptions since the opening of the Fairfax, VA Walmart and we get my husband's 5 heart medications, my asthma medication and my dogs degenerative old age medications. We spend over $1000 per month at the Fairfax Walmart. My husband went this evening to fill a prescription my dentist wrote at 4:00 PM and the pharmacist respectfully told him he would not fill the prescription and would not tell him why. This is both an inconvenience and a negative shopping experience.
*: Up until 3 months ago, I have had no issues filling my prescriptions at the Wal-Mart in Cookeville, TN. Suddenly, they are refusing to fill them. They stated they needed to know "WHY" I took one of my medications. I explained... In front of other customers in a public setting, which is uncalled for. Then they said they needed to speak to my Dr. to verbally hear why and verify the rx with them. They called, my Dr. verified I have a degenerative issue in my spine and have been on controlled low doses of pain medication to allow normal function. I also cash pay for my medication, however they tried to advise I need a prior authorization. To which I asked if I am Cash paying, no insurance, how was I supposed to get a PA? One week later, 39 phone calls and a complaint filed with Wal-Mart corporate and I was able to receive my medication.
*: I am a new customer at the Geer Rd, Walmart in Turlock, I recently changed insurance and was advised to use them. My Doctor sent 3 new Rxs in. Two were filled. One was not my pain meds. When I went to pick up my Rxs I was first told that it was too soon for the pain med to be filled. I advised that it was a new one and past due. I was sent over to discuss reason for delay. I was told that the Pharmacist thought it was a mistake and chose to not fill it. I explained that it was not an error. Then I was told they had to get the diagnosis and reason for Rx. I went back again. This I was told that it was a controlled substance and they had to call Doctor for info. I called again and was told that they had not received the info, therefore it was not filled. I explained that I was in pain and needed the meds. 
*: After 15 years of having my husband's prescriptions filled at the Walmart Pharmacy on Church Road, Kansas City. I was publicly shamed by the pharmacist on duty for his pain relief medication. He proceeded to belittle me, asking me 'what was wrong with my husband' and that 'he's on too much pain medication, he needs to go back to his doctor and get tapered'. I looked at him in shock, what gives a pharmacist the right to give medical advice? I shouldn't have, but being caught off guard, I tried to politely explain that he has a broken/fractured spine, and that if he looked at his record, he can see that my husband already has done his best to reduce his pain medication, going from three (including **) down to 1 MEDICATION! 
*: I have gone the 4436 pharmacy twice, both times the pharmacy tech cannot locate my prescription. The doctor maintains that he sent the prescription twice. The tech cannot find it. The Doctor resent while I was at the pharmacy and the tech still could not find it. The doctor's office then sent me a confirmation that they sent it to store 4436. The pharmacist on duty never wanted to get involved.
*: This review is about the Walmart pharmacy in Gardnerville, Nevada. After receiving an email saying my husband's medicine was ready to be picked up I went into the pharmacy. There was a very long line. I thought about walking out and coming back later but my husband was in the car waiting and he was in pain and needed his medicine. He has only been home from the hospital a short time. When I finally got up to the counter the clerk who was very rushed told me they didn't have any prescriptions for my husband. When I got home I called Walmart. They said that they did have a prescription ready for him. I told them what just happened when I went to pick it up and they said it must have been a computer glitch. My husband is very sick. Mistakes like these make our lives even harder. What this means is I will have to get my ill husband back in the car and run down to Walmart for a second time. 
*: On 9/24/18 I asked pharmacy if I could get my flu and pneumonia shots there at  Deptford NJ location. The pharmacist, Peter seemed confused, calling me to the front, then back then again. I had my 91 yr old mother with me, and she even noticed it was a little strange. Finally, Peter the pharmacist administered the needles straight forward into my shoulder bone, not off to the side. He commented, it had to go into the muscle and that air got in??? That was about 3pm by 6pm, my entire shoulder blew up, I was in severe pain, I called him and he said takes about 3 days take **. 
*: To be fair, my initial 2 prescription transaction with the Central Ave., Toledo, OH, Wal-Mart Pharmacy, was just fine. My recent and third experience, on Tuesday evening (10/2/18) was most unacceptable. He is my story: I called the Wal-Mart Pharmacy at 4 something p.m. on 10/2 to assure that they had received the needed prescriptions from my eye doctor. The lady affirmed the script was available, and said it would be ready for my pick-up by 6 p.m. We arrived at the pharmacy counter at 7:45, and I was told by the pleasant lady that is was not ready yet. She apologized. This cashier offered that... "we were horribly busy today". I was told to return within 15 minutes or so and also assured it would be ready then. I was admonished to return to her before the pharmacy closed at 9 p.m. I then returned a half an hour later, at which time I was informed that my prescription was ready for pick-up, and told also how much it would cost.
*: Like the reviews before me I had a very distasteful incident today. My husband was released from hospital after a full foot reconstruction. I dropped off the prescriptions and was to come back in an hour. I actually went back 3 hours later and was told they could not fill the pain pill without the doctor's verbal consent. They told me he wasn’t responding to their call. So I called the office and they paged him. After 25 minutes he responded however we had another issue. Apparently Walmart has set new guidelines and will not fill the dosage of pain pill my husband will need for his foot. 
*: Almost a year ago I went to pick up my prescription at pharmacy in Hazel Dell Vancouver Washington. As I was waiting I got talked into the flu shot and ammonia shot. Against my better judgment I still got it anyway, wish I never would’ve. The pharmacist said it ministered it. She put the desk on my arm look like a little Band-Aid with a clear window, she told me she was going to give me one shot before the other student want to hurt him more. So she gave me the first one that was supposed to hurt the worst. That was fine. No problem. She gave me the second one which I’m pretty sure it’s the flu shot and I came about 12 inches off the chair. It hurt so bad immediately and there was tingling in my fingers all the way up the back of my head and I said I didn’t feel right. Something is wrong. 
*: My doctor’s office called in a recurring medication for me. Hours later, I received no word from the pharmacy that it was ready. I called the pharmacy myself and was placed on hold. One of the ladies got on and said that although they called it in, they need to verify with them why I was taking it since I hadn’t been prescribed before. I let her know that I had and that I’ve filled it there before to which she replied “snobbish” and asked why. I let her know that they were for mouth ulcers. She asked how long had I had Them to which I told her, "For 13 years."
*: I got a text on 9/9/2018 that my prescription was ready. That was Sunday, I forgot to go on Monday 9/10/2018. The store closed because of Florence (the hurricane) 9/11/2018 until 9/16/2018. I went to pick it up and they had put it back. They didn't even wait one day before putting it back after just opening today.
*: Having used this pharmacy for years because I trusted them to charge fairly, I found out this week how wrong I was. This pharmacy is 25 miles from where I live. My daughter had picked up one of my husband's prescriptions for me on Tuesday as she was in town... I am 84 years old and my husband has only a few weeks to live. They charged her $129.45. I called the next day, explaining that I had checked in my little town of 2,000 folks and the local pharmacy would charge $27.00 for exactly the same thing! So I asked to return the one I can't really afford. They agreed, seeing as it had not even been taken out of the original WalMart bag. 
*: I never had a problem refilling my meds until today. The pharmacist was rude and told me that she did not feel comfortable refilling my rx until she spoke to my Dr. I told her that my Dr does not take pharmacy calls. She said the nurse could take care of it. I said there is no nurse. It’s just the Dr and a receptionist who is frankly dippy. I could get nowhere with the pharmacist. I have been on this medication for 10 years and now they question a refill. She would not tell me anything. I said that, "I am the patient and I have every right to know why you won’t refill my rx." I’ll call my doctor tomorrow and see if she will call Walmart. Frankly, I’m disgusted. My insurance has Walmart as a preferred provider. If I go elsewhere my cost will increase greatly.
*: I have been using Walmart for years to get my medicine. I get a call the day before which is today that I need my medicine and was told he can't fill it and I need to come pick up my script they have had on file. They have been filling the same medicine for me for almost 4 years now. I am disabled and need my medicine. I will be contacting my lawyer. You have to be weaned off this medicine. You should not be able by law to tell someone 2 days before to come get your script. I will be taken this as far as I can so no one else in my situation has to ever go through this. No one at the pharmacy could even give me a reason as to why and you cannot understand the pharmacy.
*: I have used Wal-Mart Pharmacy for literally years. However, in the last 3 months it has been a real feat getting scripts from them. First, they drug shamed me right there at the counter in front of other customers. My script is not a controlled substance, not a pain medication, etc. It was very embarrassing. It was the Friday before Memorial Day and they said they couldn't fill it until they got verification from my doctor which meant I couldn't get the refill for 3 more day, even though it was a refill for a non-controlled script. (IT may be a HIPAA violation to discuss scripts with a customer in such a manner.) Then they raised the amount of the prescriptions by 40% and told me that my healthcare company had raised the price. 
*: The pharmacies of Walmart are now requiring an additional unneeded step after purchasing a prescription. For prescriptions I have taken for years and not for narcotics. I am now being told it is required by law. I just had to wait an additional 15 minutes after the initial wait time before purchase just for the pharmacy to review my name and verify I had no questions. All of which I had already answered. His is a stupid unnecessary, time-consuming step. Why in the heck would they put this step in as they have. It is a waste and serves no purpose. I HATE Walmart Pharmacy!
*: Walmart Pharmacy and I have never had a problem till recently. They are now have me run out of my **, which is a 30 script. Now I can't get till the 31st day and have never given me a reason why! Not happy.
*: Today Walmart Corporate told me through a pharmacist that they were not going to fill any prescription for a controlled substance... I take a medication for Parkinson's along with other medications, now Walmart is stating that they feel that these medications are not going to be filled. They failed to state a reason? I believe that it is time to start fighting back against improperly informed corporate delinquents, who have no access to my medical records, do not know what my medical conditions are, have no authority to overrule a doctor in the care of my medical conditions. It is time for a class action lawsuit against companies that attempt to subvert the law including the Americans with disabilities act along with other federal laws which appear to have been violated... I would welcome any attorney to begin proceedings.
*: On 2 occasions Walmart Pharmacy has shorted my husband and I on our pain medicine. Please be aware and have them count it at the consultation area, otherwise if you leave the store they will not give you what they shorted you.
*: This review is directed at Walmart Corporation not their underpaid underappreciated employees. Walmart plays this game of charging you full price as often as they can get away with it. It doesn’t matter how recent or often you have updated your health insurance and prescription drug coverage. They will claim that the drug is not covered or that your insurance doesn’t cover it. Most likely both are lies.
*: I am a well educated person, was waiting at the pharmacy for a long time, came up that the pharmacist was waiting for the dr to call to clarify a dosage of a laxative for my baby, when I tried to ask her nicely saying if there is two doses can we go with the lower dose, once of a sudden she started screaming and talking at me saying I can’t I can’t I can’t. Everyone in line was giving me that look such as a drug addict was trying to force the pharmacist to give him something. This is not a way to talk to a customer and of course after two hours of waiting time she refused to call the pediatric office and we walked out without the medication. If you care about your time and see that you deserve some respect find another nearby pharmacy to deal with. Pharmacist’s name is: April ** at Walmart Pharmacy Tega Cay, South Carolina.
*: I am writing this review so that everyone is aware of what Walmart is doing to the people who find themselves at the end of the journey to relieve their pain and are on pain management. Not one pain management patient I have talked to desires to be where we are. Most if not all have already gone through Xrays, MRI, CAT Scans, injections, physical therapy, psychology and surgeries. We end up on pain management because there are no more treatments!!! This enables us to get out of bed in the morning, go to work to support our families or provide us with enough pain relief that we can enjoy our lives. There is no "high" that we get from pain medications... it's for pain relief only. Our pain management physician has all of our doctor reports and is very well aware of why we are sitting in their office. We do not go to them first... we go to them LAST. 
*: I am currently without insurance for a couple more months, and was told last month that Walmart would no longer be accepting discount cards for **. My doctors took me off of NSAIDs because of blood pressure issues, and my bp has gotten better! I can't take **, won't take ** bc of seizures. So what does that leave? **. But, like my doctor said, "change your pharmacy, YOU ARE MY LIABILITY, NOT WALMART'S!" So, I picked up my script of ** today, and will NEVER, EVER set foot in Walmart again. Btwn the new pharmacy, Hy-vee Costco, and AMAZON... I'LL BE JUST FINE. WALMART has way overstepped their bounds, and will never get another dime from me. It blows my mind they are so concerned for us, mostly baby boomers... yet. Are NOT about the child-labor sweatshops that they use in China to make their products. That is beyond PATHETIC.
*: Walmart is a rip off - I will not go back. I went to see an eye doctor today & he looked up online to see which place is cheaper. He showed me the computer screen & the cheapest was $17 at Walmart. When I went in to get it they said it was $42. This is the 2nd time they’ve done this - the first time it was a different medication that I got at Safeway for $13 and Walmart charged me $65.
*: I went to Walmart here in Fairbanks, AK and they always nicely fill my scripts. Well, I go back there for a refill and there was a new pharmacist working one I never dealt with before. The worker nicely runs my script and says, "Let me see if I got enough". Then the new pharmacist quickly runs over to see what my script is... without hesitation she rudely denies me right there on the spot???? With disgust in her face???? Unbelievable! Her reason was "I don't feel comfortable filling this." Ummm... it's not like I brought a ** script in, I brought my ** script that I been on for over 3yrs. 
*: Husband pain management doctor called in a prescription for narcotic... the same meds he has taken for years. They refused to fill it because my husband has a pain pump. The pills are for breakthrough pain which is better than a bolus machine. The pharmacist started rattling off the side effects to taking the medication. I interrupted him asking if he had a MD behind his name. What makes a pharmacist believe he has a right to overstep the doctor. Pulling all my meds out of Walmart and going back to my neighborhood pharmacy.
*: I've been taking pain pills for years now. (Which is the lowest dose.) Suddenly I'm told by Walmart that unless I switch Doctors and go to pain management that they would not fill my prescription. I had no choice as no other pharmacy would accept me in this small town but to switch doctors. Mind you I still have anxiety going to my normal Dr. Along with my narrowed spine, I have chronic migraines, anxiety (which the new Dr wont allow me to take meds for now and I ONLY took as needed not every day), PTSD from my mother being killed in front of me, gout and I could go on...
*: My wife went to WalMart to get our Meds since we use Humana and WalMart is the preferred pharmacy, we started to get our Meds there. I can tell you that the pharmacist was horrible. I went to pick up our medicine, since the system had called me to let me know that it was ready. The lady at the pick up side said that she did not have it ready. I said to her that I got a call and it said that it was ready, and asked to speak with the pharmacist. He came in and started to speak to me which I could not understand him, his accent was so thick. I am an immigrant and do know about thick accents since I had one, then, he asked me to go to CVS or to Walgreens. Well those pharmacies are NOT my preferred one. Please Wal-Mart take care of this mess.
*: My 5 yr old son had surgery this morning and got discharged at 10am. We dropped the prescription off at 10:15am. So then I get a phone call that it's the wrong strength and that she would call the dr as soon as she got off the phone with me. So then she calls me back and said that she had to leave a voicemail and that I should call to get it going faster. So I did it because my son just had surgery and they don't care. When I was a pharm tech I would elevate the call to the dr. But nope we didn't get that service. So I called at 6:30 pm because I thought I would of received a phone call that it was ready but NOPE! So they said it was ready. It's not how you run a pharmacy! I want something done!!!
*: I have been picking up my pain medicine from my local Walmart for years. Today I went in and they told me my script will be less than the normal amount. I inquired why and the man rudely stated, "Because people abuse these pills and you now have to manage your pain better". I told him I was in a severe accident and need my regular dosage that my body is used to. I asked if he could contact my dr to see if it was a mistake. He stated that even if it was a mistake and got corrected, he would contact my dr again and make him give me even less medicine. What gives this pharmacist the right to do that? He does not know my medical history. I was so embarrassed by this man today.
*: For the last 2 months the Wal-Mart Pharmacy in Kimball Tennessee don't have most of my prescriptions. I have to wait or go somewhere else. I have been using this pharmacy since it opened. I can see one but not three.
*: I am so mad at Walmart Pharmacy I could scream. I am a pain management patient. Have been for years. I use a discount card SingleCare to purchase my pain meds. Have for a couple of years. I am on Social Security Disability and don't have Medicare yet and no Medicaid. I can't afford insurance, so I rely on discount cards so I can afford my medications. Today I get a text my prescription is ready, instead of my usual $20.00 it's $105.00. I call them and they don't take discount cards for pain medications anymore. Because I might be a druggie. I have to have someone get my prescription and take it Walgreens where it's going to more than double my cost. I am disabled and can't get around to do this for myself right now. WALMART THERE ARE HONEST PEOPLE IN TREATMENT, WHO NEED THESE MEDS. I got my social security disability first try because of my pain. Corporate can go to hell.
*: I work in medicine for a major pharmaceutical company and have for over a decade. I understand the rules and why things have to be the way they are. That doesnt mean I agree with them. Walmart pharmacists are the worst. They are in general arrogant and obviously have esteem issues among other things. I unfortunately have been terribly ill and did not realize how absolutely invasive and offensive pharmacists can be. They had the nerve to lecture me about a medication that my doctor and I agreed to taking. 
*: I contacted my doctor's office asking for a few scripts to be faxed to Walmart Pharmacy on the 23rd, a week in advance, because the Walmart Pharmacy here keeps screwing stuff up. One week later, on the day the prescriptions were to officially be filled, the pharmacy told me they had not received any scripts from my doctor - even though I had verification from my doctor's office on the 23rd, 2 hours after I requested the scripts to be sent to Walmart.
*: I have used Walmart's online pharmacy for several years for my monthly supply of medical drugs for Type II diabetes. In the past I have done this by first logging into Walmart.com, then into the online pharmacy where I could check to see how many prescriptions I have remaining and to refill them whenever needed. At some point in 2017 Walmart's online pharmacy changed its online security methodology and from that point I have not been able to be verified or to login at the online pharmacy login site. Each time I was referred to my local Walmart pharmacy store at 1911 Marsha Sharp Fwy, Lubbock, Texas to be "verified" but three trips to my local pharmacy have yet to resolve the login problem.
*: Won’t fill pain meds from 2002 injury - I have been in pain management since my work accident in 2002. Only problems I have had filling this is from insurance, or lack thereof. On May 10, 2018 I had been to my monthly appointment. He faxes my prescription to Walmart. For several months now, every now and then they are out and I have to return when they get their shipment in.
*: I took an Uber from My Pain Management to refill my pain meds from an elevator crash 16 years ago breaking my legs and my back. Never had a problem. They were always easy and pleasant to me. When I gave the prescription to the woman at the drop off window she greeted me by name. Said it would be about 30 to 45 minutes. That's fine. I am not mobile. I was in an electric cart. Went and got a few grocery items. Went back. My prescription wasn't ready, another went by. The Pharmacist said the dosage was too high and he needed to confirm from the Dr.??? It was actually lower than last year and lower what my Dr wanted me to take. 
*: On several occasions I've tried to fill/refill prescriptions only to be told they are out of stock. What's worse is they say they don't know when inventory will be received. How can a business that absolutely affects the health of consumers not have inventory??? I was without a thyroid medication for nearly a week before. Now, I can't get a prescription for my daughter filled because of this nonsense and she's been without it for 3 days. I've had to call my daughter's pediatrician to see if they will send it to another pharmacy. Walmart tells me they don't know what they're receiving on a daily basis and I'm supposed to call every day to see if the drug is in. No thanks, I'll take my chances with a reputable company going forward.
*: Took a legitimate prescription to the new Neighborhood WalMart in Murrells Inlet SC located at Frontage Road. The pharmacist called me 5 minutes after I dropped it off angrily stating a schedule 2 med from out of state could not be filled in SC nor at any Walmart, it was the policy. I've been filling this for years without incident. When I arrived I was told the "city where the Rx was written is filled with clinics that write this stuff and hand it out like candy". I'm apparently lucky "she didn't keep my Rx and report me" (for what? trying to fill a prescription?). I asked if she called and verified the Rx but was told "she didn't need to because who knows what kind of relationship I have with this doctor" What the heck? 
*: So I have been taking opioid for several years due to major back problems. These last few months of filling my script at Walmart pharmacy had been a pain. They lecture me, make me wait forever and barely want to hand the medication over. I do not abuse the meds. I take them as prescribed by my doctor but they still treat me like I'm an addict. I have all the verification I need from the doctor, insurance company, etc to have this medication legally every month. I went to get it filled today and they told me 30 min it would be done. Check back in 30 and they say they will not fill because they no longer fill prescriptions from my doctor's office. I just don't get it since that has never been a problem before. I think they just make up excuses not to fill prescription pain meds for anybody these days.
*: I dropped 2 prescriptions to the Walmart Pharmacy on Philips Hwy-Jacksonville FL. One was new (a $4 antibiotic) and the other was a refill of an anti-fungal that I first got filled at the Walmart on Normandy Blvd. It took 2 days for the Philips Hwy Walmart Pharmacy to fill the antibiotic and 5 days to fill the anti-fungal. When I went to pick up the anti-fungal (14 pills, 100mg) I was told the cost was over $91. I disagreed, explaining that it was a $39 Rx refill that I'd already had filled once at the Walmart Pharmacy on Normandy 3 weeks ago and that 2 days prior the Philips Hwy pharmacist had already confirmed the $39 cost for the refill. The tech leaned over the register at me and said "Well, this ISN'T the Walmart Pharmacy on Normandy, this is the Walmart Pharmacy on PHILIPS." I was also told I could not use my Good Rx coupon. I told this Tech that the price isn't right and to cancel the RX, I would transfer it back to the other Walmart Pharmacy. 
*: I went to the Walmart at I-10 East Freeway @ Freeport St to have my prescription for my pain medicine filled, as I have every 2 weeks for the last 2 years, to be told I needed to have my Doctor fax over my treatment plan. I physically pick up the prescription from my doctor's office and carry it to this same pharmacy every 2 weeks. My doctor did not feel comfortable passing my medical information via fax, anyone would have access to it which is a violation of my rights under HIPAA. The pharmacist refuses to fill my prescription with no good reason. I have seen this doctor since I was 15 years old, I'm 46 now, I think that qualifies as a good doctor/patient relationship. 
*: This is my horrible experience with Walmart Pharmacy at 5302 North Garland Ave., Garland Texas 75044, on April/16/2018. This morning after my visit of my doctor, he faxed all my prescriptions to the above pharmacy. After two hours I went to Walmart, I was told that the medications shall be ready until one P.M, so I went back until 2.30 P.M, to make sure it is ready for me. This time I was told it is still not ready & was asked to wait another 10 minutes. Afterward, it is another wait for 10 more minutes, so on & so on. Eventually, I had to leave for my wife who is in the hospital. Walmart is the worse pharmacy I ever experienced. If you don't mind to stuck into a situation of an endless waiting for your prescriptions. Go Ahead & wish you luck!
*: To make a very long story short, following several months, well no, years of unprofessional service I finally decided to voice my concerns with corporate. I was assured that the situation would be dealt with. Unfortunately I believed this. Recently when I called to ask a question the person I spoke with wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise, we were going nowhere as we were now raising OUR voices, so I hung up. The individual actually called me back within minutes and told me to never come into that pharmacy again as I wasn't welcomed there and hung up!! Can you say Human Rights issue? This store in Niagara Falls NY has the most ignorant, non-professionals that one can EVER imagine. STAY AWAY, many other stores nearby with comparable prices.
*: After moving to Bonham Tx from Allen Tx at Kroger's and believing Walmart would work okay for my pharmacy needs I was unfortunately disappointed. I brought in all of my prescription bottles so they could see the drug, date last filled, mg size and prescribing doctor. Several times they had several trainees on during the same shift the service was slow and inadequate while looking for my only to be surprised when the pharmacist said they could not fill it since they were going to lunch. I had never had this poor of pharmacy service until I discovered what they did next. 
*: On March 7th, I went to the Walmart at 3829 US Hwy 77 in Corpus Christi Texas. I went to the pharmacy there to pick up two prescriptions called in by my doctor. The clerk that waited on me was rude and would not listen to me. I told her I had two prescriptions to pick up and I gave her my name and date of birth. After she checked, she came back and insisted that I had 3 prescriptions to pick up. I told her no that there was only two and she argued and said that the doctor must of added a generic and besides it was in with my other medicine. She was rude of course and told me I had to take all of them and that the extra prescription was on five dollars. So to cut down on the conflict from her, I paid for them and left. I took the meds when I got home for my nightly dosage and got sick and sat back and passed out. 
*: Walmart Pharmacy- Daphne, AL. My wife and I went to this pharmacy today to get my prescription of ** filled. The woman pharmacist refused to fill it. When we asked her why she said "that was her preferred judgment". Asked her to explain it. She refused. We then went to the assistant Manager, Julia. She said there was nothing she could do. Since I have been doctoring since 1992 (since I broke my back and have been exposed to Agent Orange) including but not limited to: orthopedic surgeon, neurosurgeon, family doctor and now a pain doctor and given different medications and am now on **. I am positive this pharmacist who is employed by Walmart has violated my civil rights by denying not to fill my prescription even though I am also 100% disabled vet. I have every intention of filing a lawsuit and hope more customers also file.
*: Wal-Mart is convenient and is probably the main reason I use them. They carry the medicines I use and the co-pay is cheap. Reorders are easy via phone or online. I travel a lot and getting refills in different states is easy. I have had no issues using War-Mart Rx.
*: Just left the doctor's office. Was prescribed 10mg of ** once a day. Picked up my medication. Went home. Ate supper. Popped a pill. As I looked at the bottle which stated 20 mg of ** cut in half take once a day. Well why would you do that to a person who reads a prescription bottle when they just left the doctor's office and she told you how to take this pill. This was an awful experience. I have anxiety which is why I'm taking **. I had an awful night and am having an awful day. Side effects are amazing. No one should have to go through this. Do not trust. Read and now do we trust what's in the bottle if it is the drug it's supposed to be. Very bad experience and you wonder why I didn't read it why should I. Left the doctor's office 10 minutes ago talking about this drug that I'm going to take.
*: I understand the epidemic of opioids but everyone should not be accused of abusing meds! I have been taking ** for more than three years and have had this issue numerous times! I am out of medication which I SHOULD NOT JUST STOP! Walmart never called my doctor! I sent them an email and yet I went to pick up my script and it was not filled! They also tried to blame the doctor! They now have a policy at this store in Norwich, NY that they REFUSE TO FILL MY SCRIPT UNTIL 30 days add ER last fill/refill! This is causing me so much stress and aggravation! I have been without my meds, even though my insurance would accept filling the script a couple days prior to 30 days! Why is Walmart policing my doctor-prescribed medication that’s I HAVE NO HISTORY OF ABUSING! They literally stated “they were the addiction police,”. What on earth is happening! If I lose a pill I am out of luck and considered an abuser! 
*: Why is it that when you pay for your script you have to go stand in another line so the pharmacist can bag it. What the hell is this. Stand in line to get script then pay then stand in another line while pharmacist takes it out of the bag then puts it back in the bag. What a waste of my time. First I was told it was a state law. LIE. Then it was Walmart policy. Who make this policy. I refuse to go to another line and raise holy hell till they give me my script.
*: Walmart Pharmacy Johnsburg, IL - I have been filling my prescription at Walmart for years, I take ** for anxiety. My doctor does NOT provide refills so I have to physically go into the office every month to get a prescription. Brought the script in the same day doc wrote it like I've done for years, the staff told me my insurance declined to fill it as it was 4 days early. 
*: 1 Day post op and I called to ask about a medication. They hang up on me. They are rude and lack compassion. Anybody can work in the medical field and learn from a textbook... But you need compassion while dealing with patients.
*: I have transferred two prescriptions to two other pharmacies. The most recent was for a refill of a drug I use when symptoms set in. I have insurance. The price for six of these pills at Walmart was $42.00 for six pills. I asked if there was a generic replacement. Their answer was NO. I left the store, went home and researched the pill I am taking and guess what? There is a generic for it. The next surprise came when I went online and found a discount card thru Walgreens for $82.50 for 30 pills making it $2.75 per pill versus $6.08 per pill. I had my prescription transferred to Walgreens. Went back to Walmart and showed them my receipt from Walgreens and they countered with 36.50 for 6 pills.
*: I have logged in innumerable times to this site. All I wanted this time was a printout of my 2017 subscription purchases. But suddenly, I get "Walmart has instituted a new level of security to protect your identity." Okay, no problem right? I answer ALL the questions accurately -- date of birth, phone number, pin, etc. "We're sorry. You cannot access your account at this time. Please bring your ID to your local pharmacy and we will we glad to initiate access to your account." WHAT???
*: The pharmacy assistant at the register, Arvealetta, was rude and dismissive. She has been unprofessional on several occasions and continues to be so. For that reason, I have decided to remove my business from your pharmacy and will encourage my family and friends to do so if/when they encounter this woman's rudeness.
*: The pharmacy had one of my prescriptions ready to go but it had to be held for a few days due to refill guidelines. The pharmacy admitted they took the script off the shelf and used to for another patient. When I went to pick up my medicine I was told they were out. This was Wednesday the 7th, after I told the pharmacy that was unacceptable they gave me 7 pills, and stated the rest would be in on Thursday. I called Thursday and they said it would be Friday. It is Friday now I am running out of my medicine and the pharmacy tech said it could be as late as Monday. The pharmacy didn’t even call me, I had to call them! I would like to know the legality and duty the pharmacy has to fulfill orders.
*: My doctor electronically sent in a prescription. 1/30/18. I have enough until 2/7/18. These are 30 day scripts and I usually get it filled on that day. Here it is day 29 and they’ve had 10 days to order and they said it still didn’t come in. Very dangerous and unprofessional.
*: Bought generic ** at Walmart with Humana insurance. It cost 97.50. Could have gotten it at Kroger with just a good RX coupon for 51.00. Kroger is better every time. Finally I have figured it out. Walmart will rip you off.
*: I'm the sole caregiver for my grandparents and they use Walmart Pharmacy. For the past two years I have been taking care of them and also have the very unfortunate task of going to and dealing with Walmart. My grandfather only has a few prescriptions that only need refilled every once in a while, however my grandmother is a diabetic, along with having numerous other necessary medications. I am in the pharmacy at least once a week, if not, three or four times. I know that all but two of the employees in there are all completely clueless, including the pharmacist. Funny enough, the one employee who is the most ignorant and rude is the only one that doesn't have their certifications on the wall. Kind of makes me wonder.
*: At the beginning of the new year I brought in my new Part D insurance cards to start using Walmart Pharmacy for the new year for 2018. At the time I did not have an Rx to fill but the gal at the pharmacy took the cards to put on file. Soon after my doctor called in an Rx and the pharmacy used my old Rx card to fill the Rx. I found this out before I went to pick up my meds and got it fixed with the pharmacy over the phone. When I went to pick up my meds they still had not used my new cards AND they implied that I gave them the wrong cards. They were beyond condescending... The pharmacist laughed at me and asked if I needed to have someone explain how this worked.
*: Took 4 days resolve after went back. Staff actually called tech, he didn't notify because didn't hear back and since tried prior locked out, if locked out staff only one get unlocked. This guy very helpful. Once unlocked tonight finally works now, didn't even need do security. Saw must had issue my account they had fix since tech got whole info including email. Also so go staff tell them call tech. First day there half hour but eventually worked. I have too many addresses and probably can't delete. Might been another issue. Wish could delete all those though.
*: Walmart Pharmacy App is pretty well broke. I send in a refill... They say it is not received! I can't access My Pharmacy to see the scripts available to me...because of fraud concerns! I requested access but they blocked me! Their response: "We received your request to access your Walmart Pharmacy account but unfortunately some of the information did not match what we have on file. To protect your healthcare information, we have a strict online validation process that guards against fraud. We know this can be an inconvenience for some customers, especially when information does not match and we are unable to immediately grant access. 
*: The Walmart pharmacy in Yuba City California, think that everybody that uses an high dosage of ** is a drug addict. They accused me of being a drug addict and I am misusing my medication. I am a leukemia survivor in remission with side effects. I have arthritis in my ankles, neck, back, wrist, and hands. The head pharmacist have no right to tell my new pharmacy that I transfer to, that I am a drug addict.
*: They have no Quality Assurance (QA) in processing their online orders. Most of the time their system is broken. If you order a refill that requires a new prescription from the doctor, the transaction is removed from an online status and moved to a manual status. Once there, even after the new prescription is received, they do not process it automatically. Instead, if you signed up for telephone notifications they are suppose to call you and verify that you actually want the drug. Of course if you did not sign up for notifications, the transaction is put on hold. So, after you run out and call them, then they try to process it, but the manual data they have does not match what is in the online system, so all their data (credit card info) is outdated and the transaction fails. Again if you're not signed up for notifications the transaction is put on hold again.
*: As I Cyber Security threat researcher and a Customer of Wal-Mart I was very disturbed that one of your Pharmacy Technicians chose to post a screenshot of her work computer on Facebook.

*: Went online like I always have to view my pharmacy orders. Walmart has instituted a new log in that requires a security code. After signing up and logging in, it tells you that you must sign in as a guest and pick up your medications at your local pharmacy. THIS IS AN ONLINE PHARMACY. There is no local Walmart for me to pick up prescriptions and I didn't want to order anything - just view my account. The customer service department I called says they are aware of the issue but they can't give me any information about my account due to privacy issues. It could also take up to 2 days for them to contact me. So, let me get this straight. I can't access my medications online and Walmart can't either. And I have to wait until they get around to me in order to figure it out! This will undoubtedly turn into a major legal issue for Walmart down the line. I hope they get their crap together because this is completely unacceptable.
*: This is the second time Wal-Mart Pharmacy has withheld my medication unless I give them medical information. It isn't even the pharmacist who is asking the information. It is an employee in a smock. I just saw my primary care physician and they called in the medication for me. It is a topical cream. I have been on it for 3 years and suddenly they are refusing to refill my prescription unless I answer medical questions.
*: Today was the 2nd time Walmart has been OUT of my medications (**)... And they tried to give me a $50 ** instead of the $10 (3 month) one when they finally came in. I refused so they took it back and gave me the $10 one. When I asked what the difference was, they said they changed manufacturers for the $4 and $10 pills. They're still out of **, it's been about 2 weeks. I asked why, they said they're very busy and having trouble keeping up.
*: I am a 60 year old disabled man who has been getting my pain medication at Walmart for almost 2 years and they decided they would no longer fill it without any concern for my pain, basically saying, "Tough luck," with no empathy. I really believe they could care less about your health are wellness. It's all about profits.
*: For the last two months my Dr has got me in a few days early so when I left they put my medicine on file. I was told that they would be filled on a certain day so I go expecting to pick up when I get there. They then tell me they're out of stock!!! Now by this time I'm completely out of my meds and now they're saying they have to order... This doesn't make sense to me. Hey Wal-Mart wake up, get off your butts and do your jobs!!!
*: Beware. You get what you pay for. Went there to save money on my prescriptions. I don't understand how can they not have your order ready after you get a email. Then they have no record of me placing my order online. Had to go back to the window to re-order them again and after waiting for a very long time I go up to see if they are ready and no one was even working on them or received my order yet again they asked me DID you order them. I just told them forget it I will go somewhere else. They really need to get their crap together. And we trust these people with our lives. Let's hope that they never have a huge mistake that will cost someone their life!!!
*: I have always dreaded filling my prescription at Walmart because every tech behind the counter thinks that they are better than you, especially if you're filling something like **. I am so sick and tired of being judged for having this vice. They lied to me on this occasion saying they sent my prior authorization to my doctor. This was Thursday... So Friday it's obvious nothings gonna get done and I fill a 3 day script for 60 dollars. Monday comes along and I call my doctor around noon and they say they still haven't received the authorization. I call the pharmacy and they say it usually takes a week. They ask where the doctor is out of again and the fax so clearly they never sent it. Once again your neighborhood Walmart discriminating its paying customers. Now I'm sick from withdrawals and it's on you Walmart so ** you.
*: Shorted my prescription 11 pills and my prescription wasn't to be ready till 4 days later. They made me come back with what pills I had left to only give me 3 pills of the 11 shorted. Then when I went back to get the refill and only got 4 pills because they didn't have any in stock!! This pharmacy is a joke, my prescription is life or death and they want to play around. This isn't a controlled medication. They have repeatedly shorted medication.
*: I filled my pain prescriptions here occasionally because I picked up groceries. But the service and communication was very poor. The pharmacy website is horrible. My Rx I dropped off yesterday was delayed and I was told to called them next day after waiting for 30 mins. They don't even offer to contact me at all. After more than 14 hours, I hear nothing from them! Lazy employees and careless system. They don't seems to be happy with their jobs like most of them working here. One more thing, I have just found out the cost for my pain pills was 60% more than at W. I am going back to the real pharmacy with professional system and attitude.
*: I went to Wal-Mart for my shingle shot and sat there for 1.5 hrs. When they pulled the gate for lunch. One of the assistants came out and said, “Oh you with the shot it’s not authorized” and walked away. I'M on SS disability and have Humana insurance so when I called them I was told by Humana it had been authorized 1.5 hrs ago. I called the store manager and he was told the assistant though I couldn't afford it. The manager then gave me a $20 dollar gift card and apologized. My spine is so bad it takes me15 minutes once I'm in the store to get to the pharmacy. Shame on Wal-Mart.
*: I have been going to the Walmart Pharmacy for five years now. This last year has been horrible. I am using a new drug and they never had it stocked. I would order it with other prescriptions go pick them up, come home minus that new drug and no one told me. Very inconvenient. I live out of town and not close to the Walmart. Another thing happened that we are just now figuring out. I thought this was my fault for the last few weeks. It is not, at all. About a month ago my doctor called and added to a prescription. Well Walmart dropped what I needed and used the new one the doc called in. No one let me know. I kept using the old prescription use of 2 tablets and ran out a few weeks early. This affected my sleep. For 2 weeks there it was messed up without the drug. Weeks later it is now getting straightened out. I switched to another pharmacy. Enough is enough.
*: I tried using the Walmart app to refill my prescriptions but it does not work. When placing my order it sends a text telling me the order will not be ready for another two weeks. When I contact the pharmacy to ask why it takes so long to process my order. They say it will be ready the next day. Sometimes when I place my order through the app the pharmacy does not receive it at all. Needless to say I will not be using the app at all to refill prescriptions. It does give a list of all my prescriptions in case I need to refer back to them though.
*: My doctor called in my pain medication last week Tuesday for my acute chronic pancreatitis to the boiling springs SC Walmart. They didn't want to fill the script last Tuesday because they were either prejudice or ridiculous because the pharmacist said the medication was too expensive to process the script. If you thought the medicine was too expensive, can't your brain process the thought of following up with the doctor that wrote the script. That's the excuse I got when I called Thursday morning to find out where my medicine was. Then when I complained Thursday, they claimed they ordered it Thursday and it would arrive Tuesday. Then when I called this morning Tuesday and demanded to speak with the store manager because pharmacy kept hanging up, or letting the phone just ring, he went over to talk to them. 
*: I've been getting my ** and ** for years here. Here's my problem, I've had refills on my ** that they said were too early, and then they don't have them, and then I'll be a refill Short. I honestly believe that they've screwed up more times than I can count! Also, now, they tell me I cannot fill my ** during the same amount as the **, even though, I only use the ** for extreme pain during menstruation and I have Crohn's disease and it helps me, but they're saying they can't do it. I've had it with them! I've never had such poor service and made to feel like a Junkie, even though I've NEVER filled it early ever! I'm sick of them. It was embarrassing and disgusting. I don't understand why if my DR of over 18 years knows me, why Walmart can decide which is right for me.
*: I have been using WM's pharmacy for many, many years and have found the pharmacists very helpful and patient. I have no complaints about them at all. The other employees of the pharmacy can be hit or miss and are often sloppy, causing us to drive to the pharmacy to pick up an item only to find out it's not ready after all but I usually avoid this by asking to speak to the pharmacist about my orders - which they themselves have recommended. I often order my refills online but lately - since September 2017 - I have not been able to log into my pharmacy account. I have worked with online customer service and was even sent to an "escalated" type of help but they ended up telling me I had to "verify" my account in the pharmacy and things would start working. The problem is the pharmacists have not heard a word about this. Just wondering if anyone else is suddenly having problems accessing their pharmacy account.
*: I received a call from Walmart re: ** 40 mg recall. I had a full bottle that was filled 9/5/17. Thankfully I had not yet started taking. I called Walmart and it was explained to me that they found out 9/26/17 about the recall and then called me. I went onto website and found article dated 8/15/17 explaining about the recall of this drug. I believe Walmart dropped their responsibility on this one. I will either have to go elsewhere for my medicine or do their job and check monthly on my prescriptions for **.
*: I am a 'frequent flyer' at the Walmart pharmacy. All too often they seem baffled as to filling orders for RX sent by my doctor. The most recent event (9-14-17) was their incorrect assertion that my insurance company would not fill my prescription for three more weeks! As a direct result of their incompetence I went three days without my medication resulting in the beginnings of withdrawal symptoms and sleepless nights. This morning bright and early I paid a visit to my doctor who had already been in contact with the Walmart pharmacy in Middle Island and corrected their egregious error.
*: My daughter has real bad seizures when she dont get her meds for four time this year. I had to fight with the pharmacy to get her meds on time. And they claim not to get a fax from her doctor office when they did in fact get it... They just like toying with peoples lives. I would trade pharmacy if I could but it the closest one that has her type of pills. But they need to get with the program soon or I'll raise hell.
*: I have had no problems with Walmart Pharmacy. What's nice that if you are out of town or whatever you can go to any Walmart and they can pull all the info up on computer and you can refill your meds.
*: Second time my Dr. ordered this and the second time they did not have it. They never notified me and I needed this medicine for a very serious life threatening condition. They are not doctors and should not have left it up to me to call them. Irresponsible behavior. Shame on them. No way to complain on their website either.
*: This is the worst pharmacy ever!!! Every time I come to the drive thru I sit and wait at least 30 minutes after they told me it would be ready in 10 minutes. Then when I told her I would wait she rolled her eyes and hung up the receiver.
*: They provide good service but the computer software needs tweaking, & some pharmacists do not look through the prescriptions to see what is expired & still valid. Also updating customer info is not happening as smooth as possible.
*: Last week I went to my Dr for my check up... Needed refills Rx. Dr called them in. Went later that evening to pick them up. Girl at the counter told me my Rx wasn't covered and I needed to call back the Dr. So I did. He recalled. I went back there the next day. They told me they were out. Couldn't get them in. I have been taking that same Rx for 10 years. BP MEDS. First they tell me I'm not covered then they tell me they don't have any. Couldn't they tell the Dr that. So he could change it. What am I supposed to do? Die? This has been going on for a while now. Are they playing God? Choosing who lives and dies.
*: This is a convoluted mess. NOT worth the time and trouble. After a week of dealing with this I'm headed anywhere but Walmart Pharmacy (online or brick-n-mortar). Started with a simple understanding that all you had to do was get your doctor to fax your prescriptions to the 1-800 # and voila you could get a 90 day supply of any prescription on the generic prescription list for only $10.00! "Great", he says. "Call my Dr. and have them transferred" he says... we received a 30 count bottle of one med and 9 - 30 count bottles of another and a $40.00 bill... $40. For the same prescriptions we could have picked up from our Walmart store for $16.00 WTHeck?!
*: I've gotten my prescriptions through Wal-Mart for years, and while some are better than others, overall they are consistent and reliable. I've been in several cities and states in the last few years, and it's always easy to transfer or pick up wherever I end up.
*: I use Walmart because of the drug program from Humana. This program allows me to get my meds for a very good price - $1.00 per month. But I do not like the service I get at Walmart or the attitude of the workers.
*: Shingles Vaccine - I am 50 years old and my dr sent a script to Walmart pharmacy in Centre, AL. They informed me that I was not allowed to have it because I was not 60. It has been approved for 50 and up but ins won't pay unless you are 60. (I had no problem paying for it out of pocket.) They refused to give it to me. My dr then sent it to CVS in Centre, AL and I received the vaccine. Is Walmart really that far behind or do they just not want to do their jobs??? We always have trouble with them and most of them are not very friendly at all!!
*: Tried to re-order a prescription online. I needed the item mailed to me because I cannot drive to pick it up. After a 'chat' with an idiot, speaking to a live idiot, transferred to Pharmacy who never answered, calling back a number concerning prescriptions being mailed, I was told, "You don't have an account to mail your prescriptions". And you know this how? Why didn't your ignorant website tell me this? And advise how to resolve the situation? End result: transferring my prescriptions to another vendor and praying really hard that Amazon buys out this monstrously stupid company. It's not just Wal-Mart, it's Sam's as well. I have never spoken to so many illiterate people in my life.
*: I have chronic insomnia and I am 65 yrs young. I do everything I can to make this problem manageable. Walmart Pharmacy has put holds on my medications more than once. The only thing that actually worked was **. I had to call my insurance provider for 3 months to get it back. When I did finally, the capsules are out of date or placebo. I am so tired of not sleeping and it's all due to the pharmacy in Tomah Wi. They give me the runaround and said my insurance put a hold on it and when my Dr.'s nurse called me she let it slip that it was the pharmacy. It would be different if I was a drug abuser but I am NOT. I JUST WANT TO SLEEP. Not getting proper rest is very detrimental. I feel very confused and depressed due to lack of sleep.
*: Walmart Pharmacy Holly Springs, NC gave me a blood pressure medication instead of a muscle relaxer! When I picked up my meds I called back to the pharmacy alerting them that my meds look different, they said; "We changed manufacturers", so I took the medication as prescribed twice per day as needed. I was weak, fainted, wrecked my car, developed SVT heart problem then Sinus tachycardia! Wore a heart monitor for a month! Have to take a beta blocker twice a day for the rest of my life! Walmart offered me 4K for my troubles! I have a life of pills thanks to Walmart Pharmacy's neglect! I want the world to know what happened to me so it doesn't happen to anyone else! I'm having to go to my cardiologist every six months for the rest of my life because Walmart Pharmacy almost caused my death! 
*: I picked up my third 90 Day Prescription since switching to Walmart last December. I ordered these refills last week knowing one would need physician approval and they still had a work day to contact him. I checked status Monday and the one had not been approved and I re-ordered. I was thinking I could pick them up when I went to town in a couple of days. I checked order status Monday and one was not refilled because they still needed to contact physician and I re-ordered again knowing it may be an issue with the 4th of July. 
*: I've been using this pharmacy for about 2 years now and I have to say I'm more than pleased. I'm actually closer to another branch but I choose to go where people treat me right. I've been to other pharmacies where I'm treated like a junkie or a criminal meanwhile I'm a single dad who's just trying to do the best he can. The staff all know me. We can even joke around and they always help me if I have a question. They've even gone out of their way to find coupons for me because I don't have insurance. Now they don't have to do any of that it's not at all in their job description but they still do. I would recommend this branch to anyone needing to switch. Bravo to the entire staff.
*: I have my prescriptions filled by Wal-Mart in Taylor PA. I'm concerned about Pharmacists that work there. Pretty much on an every other month the pharmacists there DON'T read my notes and I end up driving back to get the order right. I am worried that they are going to mess up with an order because they do not read. They filled the order wrong again and I called Walmart and the person said I'm sorry. I said, "Can you please send someone here to pick up the mistake?" "No we don't have anyone for that." I was talking to someone else about this and they said this happens to a few people he knew. SO I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS A PROBLEM WITH THEM. Then if you call 1800 Wal-Mart they tell you they're busy call back later. They CARE.
*: Pharmacy - Store 3236 - I am reporting a pharmacy employee Zan and Pharmacy manager Jemma **. I gave my prescription to Zan who Very Rudely asked if I had insurance! Told her yes, and that all my information was in the computer. Zan started screaming that there is NO INSURANCE INFO in the system AND if I have a CHARITY VOUCHER! While SCREAMING! Jemma ** did absolutely nothing to de-escalate the situation. Keep in mind I have been filling prescriptions at Walmart for over 10 yrs. with the same insurance company.
*: I was near the pharmacy at the East Rome, GA Walmart, when a man walks up beside me and just walks off with my shopping cart. I wasn't even sure how to respond at first, but managed a meek "umm...hey... that's my cart..." Of course, I was ignored. I stated a little louder "Excuse me?" Again, nothing. He just kept on walking. Well, I'm not going to stand there and allow myself to be a victim, so I said loudly "Excuse me! That's my cart!" He finally stopped, and returned it. This wasn't a big deal, maybe it was just an accident... but either way, *he* was the one in the wrong, NOT me. 
*: Pathetic service. I have been informed by the girl to pick up my prescription after 25 minutes. And even after an hour they don't even know who I am. And olderly lady is trying to search my prescription which she couldn't get hold off.
*: My wife, who has been taking the same thyroid medication for years went to Walmart in Morgantown, PA to get her prescription. She was given the wrong pills. These generic pills have the same active ingredients as the pills she has been taking for the last 20 years, but the inactive ingredient are much higher in salt content which raises her blood pressure. The pharmacists was very rude insisting that the pills were the same. Having worked for the FDA and having checked with two other pharmacists, the FDA, and the Drug Manufacturer, I found out that I was right. And since we had gotten her prescription at this Walmart for about a year, I wanted to know why he couldn't fill it. He told us it was company policy and told me to call 1 800 Walmart to get the company's policy. 
*: Walmart store #2482, Mesa Riverview Dobson Rd., Mesa AZ. I am reporting a pharmacy employee named **, and the pharmacist who was on duty and in charge at the time, **. First let me say that I have reported ** before to the store managers at least twice, and nothing gets done about him. He is consistently rude to me and my husband when we come in, and has a very cocky attitude.
*: I am on several medications, and have been on some of them for many years. I had to get an exception for one, so I could get my full order of 90 tablets for a 30 day supply. This is one that if I miss a dose, I go through withdrawals. Well, when I got my refill the pharmacist called me, she said she didn't have the full amount. I needed some to get me through until their order came in, she said she can do that. I just called to tell them I would be there tomorrow to pick up the rest, only to be told I have to get a new prescription. She said, "When you accepted a lesser amount you're accepting as if that is what the doctor wrote for." Well, I was never told that, I would never have accepted that.
*: Called in prescription, went to pick it up. They said somehow the phone did not pick it up. I asked if I could come back later that evening to get it and she said fine. When I can be back they only had 8 pills. I usually get 3 months at a time because I take care of a bedridden patient. So... A few days later I have to go back to get the rest of that prescription only to find out they have changed hours without telling me (or anyone). I guess they do not think prescriptions for people are all that important?? So I am going back for my 4th time tomorrow to get one prescription. They could care less about people. They have the worse pharmacy hours of anyone already and they have some nerve to cut another hour off their already horrible hours. I am saying bye to this irritating group of people who could care less about their customers... They are just too big and powerful to give a rip!
*: Discharged from hospital, counselor cited hospital pharm price of $12 for generic, but suggested Wal-Mart as low-cost supplier with $4 program and sole source for affordable diabetic supplies. Discharged four hours after estimated time, little window for wife to collect generics and test supplies. Pharmacist told her about seven day return policy. Filled generic ** and ** (each $12 at hospital) for $90 each. Pharmacist refused return of unopened bag next morning. Explained price even higher than on-line since no coupon was presented. Oh, yes. The glucose meter had a dead betters and reports 50% errors in testing. Replacement FreeStyle Lite more sensitive with 95 percent read.
*: Very Rude Pharmacy Manager Derek. Wal-Mart Pharmacy did not have one of my prescriptions ready although they'd had plenty of time to fill. So I drove forty minutes back home then came back, stood in line 15 minutes and was told it still wasn't ready, told to come back in 20 minutes, returned again and told it still wasn't ready. Finally after sometime I was paged by the pharmacy manager, as I was walking up to rx desk I said, "It's a miracle!" The rx manager took offense to this and said "Do you want to take your business elsewhere?" I said, "I'll think about that." The rx manager said "Are you going to stop being condescending and treat us respectfully?" I then said, "Condescending? Respectfully?" He then tried his best at being sarcastic ie, explaining their meaning.
*: I was feeling rather funny as if I was in an airplane making its final descent. I could feel the pressure in my head and thought I had better get my blood pressure checked. I wanted to have it checked right away and thought I could go to the ER or to Walmart. It was a "no brainer" and off to Wal-Mart I went. They have a wonderful free blood pressure machine that does lots of other things as well. Thank you Wal-Mart, I got my answer. I returned to the same machine several days in a row. I felt like I had a friend and health partner provided by the good folks at Wal-Mart. Of course, I purchased something every day. Who wouldn't?
*: I've never had any issues with Walmart Pharmacy. The employees there have always been knowledgeable and quick. Pharmacist always gets to know the customers and makes us feel important. Good team.
*: I have no problems with my Walmart. The pharm people are excellent and knowledgeable. They have enough people to kick out the prescriptions. And so there's hardly any wait time -- my Walmart pharmacy is in Dallas on Montfort and Arapaho road.
*: Wal-Mart is a no nonsense place to get your prescriptions at a reasonable price. They have a 90 day supply offer that can't be beat by any of the competitors out there.
*: Wal-Mart handles a lot of prescriptions, probably more than any other facility. However the waiting lines are always long, snake around & move slowly. The good news is you can check out with your other merchandise if you have a relative small amount of items. The bad news is the pharmacist is not willing to give you advice now regarding which OTC items may work better and in 20 years I have been given the wrong RX twice. I get the feeling you're only a number.
*: Great personalized advice and instruction from the pharmacist. Quick to resolve problems. I don't hesitate to ask locations for products from the clerks.
*: Great people who are concerned about their consumers. Go out of their way to help. I cannot say enough "kind" words about the staff at this Wal-Mart.
*: The pharmacy has in several instances not filled the prescriptions until I'm physically in the store, even tho I've called ahead and been told they are ready or working on it, leaving me with a wait time of 15-30 minutes. I've stood in line waiting for help without an acknowledgement even when the staff don't seem to be busy. They do not call and tell you if the prescription cannot be filled and are not too reliable on letting you know when prescriptions are ready. On the plus side they are generally pleasant enough to deal with.
*: The people are very helpful. I think the wait time is to make you shop during this time. Usually from 30 min up to 2 hrs. I can't believe that a pharmacy this large would have to order main brand medications.
*: I feel that the price of their prescriptions is fair where a lot of others are way too high. There are many of the Wal-Mart store around the area and are easy to get to.
*: Wal-Mart Pharmacy opens too late in the morning. They have limited staff and most act like they would rather be somewhere else. The lines are horrible. For a store that operates 24/7, I feel the pharmacy should be available 24 hours.
*: For the most part this pharmacy does a good job. There are times when the waiting line gets backed up. The people are friendly and helpful. I can shop while I am waiting.
*: Products are not in stock and have to come back 2 days later. Wait time is 15-30 minutes. I had one clerk yell at me because I didn't tell them it was through GoodRx even though all my other prescriptions were through GoodRx.
*: I only have my prescription at this time. When my doctor called it in it was ready when I got there. In the past I used chain stores and the waiting was extensive.
*: This is the Wal-Mart located in Uniondale NY. The head pharmacist is extremely knowledgeable and they are great when dealing with doctors and ins. companies.
*: I feel that all the time and experience with this pharmacy and the staff I deal with no matter if it's in the daytime or evenings. I have always been happy with the helpful and very nice customer service received by either telephone or at the counter.
*: The wait time is outright disrespect to the customers, the staff shows a lack of understanding of the word "customer service". For example one day one of my family member witness a fight between two customers sick and ill, standing for a long period was due to the long wait time.
*: It's Walmart so a person comes to not expect much but the staff is prompt and courteous. The pharmacist needs a bit better of personal skills but they get the job done and it always seems to be right.
*: Gulf Shores Wal-Mart Pharmacy has trouble filling my prescriptions... my doctor even suggested I change pharmacies for this reason. I switched to the Foley Walmart.
*: The wait is sometime long but I understand that. But when you get up to the corner and right away you sense a bad vibe like no smiling, quick answers and tapping on counter with finger I feel sometimes they don't know how long of a day I had to then come to their serve and feel like I'm blower off or I was a bother. I decide me change to another store.
*: This is the fourth month in a row that I've requested prescription to be filled, given a pickup date, call to verify status of prescription and pickup date, when I arrived prescription has to be ordered, I can make up to 3 trips a month just trying to get one prescription filled. This happens repeatedly for months. My meds are supposed to be continuous or go back thru the whole plan. I contact the doctor if the pharmacy has a problem with prescription. Doctor decided to have all prescription filled for 3 months, go back again to Pharmacy and pick up all except for the one in question that I'm now completely out of, suppose to pick up today, but when I call to verify today I was told that they have no record of prescriptions.
*: Every time I go to the pharmacy at Wal-Mart on Deans Bridge rd in Augusta, GA I have had excellent service. I would recommend going through Wal-Mart to fill all your prescription needs.
*: The name of my store is Fred Meyer. The wait time is usually long. Sometimes, they will have a prescription ready and I will have to wait for another. Moreover, the pharmacy will call or text to let me know my prescriptions are ready, when only a couple really are. That gets frustrating. Despite this, they are a really good pharmacy.
*: More seating could be added, more courtesy, more registers open, longer hours, more discounts available to seniors, more things at a lower cost, wider aisles.
*: The service is great and the pharmacists and assistants work hard to assist and give good service. They provide printed materials which give the names of generic medicines and information about cost savings including discounts.
*: I don't know why but every time I call to check on a prescription they say it's ready. This is a 90 mile round trip for me! I get to the counter and they tell me it's not ready yet! "Can you come back tomorrow?" Then I usually have to wait 3 hours for them to fill it!
*: It took over 3 weeks for my last refill prescription. Was within time of refill, but still had to get Dr. authorization. This I never understood. After contacting them a 3rd time, they finally made another call and got the ok.
*: It is very clean and the pharmacists are very knowledgeable and polite. If you have a problem with your medicines, they will help as fast as they can, and if your meds are counteracting with your others, they go through to find something else you can take. They will make sure they counsel you if it's a new med, and if you are allergic to it, they will find an alternative for you.
*: I am a disabled veteran so usually I use the veteran's administration for my drug needs and only use the pharmacy for nonprescription items. The store does well but is a bit busy.
*: Wal-Mart Pharmacy has always been my go to because they do offer the $4 prescriptions and all my meds usually fall in that price range. The pharmacists are super friendly and knowledgeable. They take time to acknowledge your concerns and questions.
