*: I did a Walmart order for pick up on April 8th. On April 13th they debited my account for 107.38. Again on April 13th they debited my account for 107.38. I spent 2 days on the phone, email, and chat. Sent them all the documentation from my bank. They will not refund my money. They told me file a dispute with my bank. Now I have to take off work, go shut off my debit card, file a dispute. They are allowed to fraudulently steal from people and I have to pay the consequences.
*: Walmart Market Pharmacy in Northport, AL: IDK the name of the Asian pharmacist, but that's the only way I know to be specific about who. Every time I take scripts there, it's fine. But let me take a narcotic script there & you can see how she changes. She will talk loud about how this is a narcotic, IDK if we can fill or we don't have any of that, or narcotics make people drowsy. 
*: I unfortunately have CVS Caremark. Considering their auto-deny policy and overpriced prescriptions, I use Wal-Mart and ask for best cash price. Their people are friendly and usually outgoing to help with any problems I have, AND they offer BEST CASH PRICE on prescriptions. This is a sure win and you will be satisfied by their service.
*: I have a hard time comprehending how bad the experience can be in 2023. On hold for more than 40 minutes to refill a prescription because I need to change the credit card I have on file. Not sure if I will ever connect with anyone or if it will go on forever. It cannot tell me how long the wait is estimated to be. There is an option to get a call-back. I tried it, but it put me on hold for the callback system! After a long time waiting I hung up and re-called for the original wait. What's the point of waiting to schedule a call-back, the point is not to wait! I tried logging in online to do the same things but there is no option to change payment credit card. I cannot even refill the prescription online, it says to call the phone number. There is an option while on hold to leave a voicemail by pressing 1, but it doesn't work either. Really??
*: Went to Walmart with a prescription for my husband after just leaving the hospital, was told they couldn't read it so they couldn't fill it. We're in Florida so we then took the same prescription to Publix supermarket where they promptly and very kindly had no issue reading the prescription and filling it. Spoke with the doctor's office and was told it's at the discretion of the pharmacist if they have an issue with a prescription for any reason. Absolutely ridiculous and just shows how little Walmart pharmacist care. You could clearly see my husband was standing there with the neck brace, bands on his arm from the hospital as well as covering from two IVs. If a pharmacist at that point cares that little then I will never be back! I am moving all of his prescriptions away from Walmart.
*: I was to pick up a medicine for my wife and Walmart prepared the wrong one. I have to drive more than 5 miles, and Walmart has to delay and I had to come back in the afternoon? When the medicine was supposed to be available the day before. I have to agree with one of the reviews that it is not being laid back, it is laziness pure and simple.
*: If I could rate this store lower than 1-star I would. The attitudes are lazy, not laid back. John, the store manager is disingenuous when engaging on serious issue with the pharmacy concerning anti-epileptic medication or holding employees accountable. Walmart pharmacy's lax attitude in medication coordination is appalling and borderline negligent. The store's attitude reflects that of the manager. Buy your shower curtain there, but leave your pharmaceutical concerns to the professionals who are NOT affiliated with Walmart. Your health is too important and their attitude towards life and death medical issues is lazy and apathetic. Save yourself!
*: Walmart pharmacy on Tidewater Drive in Norfolk VA. One of her pharmacist stated my prescription would be done at 5pm. She talked to me any kind of way and then spoke with other customers about me & the situation while I'm still at the counter. I said, "All you have to do is apologize and keep it going." She says, "I'm not apologizing for ** I ain't done." Plus she spoke to me across the counter the entire time.
*: These people keep giving me the WRONG medication for my thyroids. I tell them everytime I have my meds refilled that I only take (**) Not ** because they don't seem to work with my body as (**) Does and yes there is a difference. I know this because I'm the one taking these pills. My thyroids gets out of control with this generic mess and my doctor can back that up! I've informed Wal-mart Pharmacy of this on several occasions and it makes no sense that everytime I go to have my prescription filled, that I have to continue to go through the same problem over and over...
*: I have have chronic pain, and have had surgery. I get a Schedule I medicine, and have gotten it for the last 5 years. I have prior authorization from my insurance. Now they are saying I need to tell them my diagnosis for the medicine. They said it’s been their policy for a few years. Today they want to enforce it on my prescription. After going round and round with the pharmacist, they filled it within 15 minutes of the call. I filed a complaint with the corporate office; waiting on a call back. I went there, and they were giggling ; just like when I was on the phone. The tech just looked at them for a few minutes before coming over, and she was rude. They played the game of having my prescription behind the counter, and the pharmacist had to give the rude tech the bag. She took her time again, and was rude.
*: I made an error in my original review. I said I was still waiting for my prescription on April 27. It's actually April 20. After I finished my review, I received a text saying my prescription is ready. That's two weeks after the doctor called in the prescription.
*: After being prescribed a medication that my normal pharmacy (Walgreens) didn't have on hand & would not look to see if other Walgreens in the area had it either...I went on a hunt for it myself. Having contracted shingles and in immense pain, I called up every pharmacy & grocery store within a 30-mile radius to find antiviral eyedrops since my eye was surrounded & it could cause permanent eye damage if the virus were to spread to my eye. My local Walmart pharmacy was my last call. 
*: I have a 17 yr old autistic child who takes meds. Is on Medicaid and last yr I had no issues with Walmart. His insurance paid for them. This yr one of his meds they told me would be 96 one would be 76 and one 21. A person on Medicaid normally cannot pay that much money for medicine. Would have had no issue with being on the 4.00 list. I switched over to Hy-Vee pharmacy. Same exact meds and his insurance paid for all. Will not use Walmart pharmacy again
*: They did not send my script and didn’t notify me that I needed refills. I called and was given different directions each time I called and I’m still without my meds. I wish my insurance never chose Walmart for my home delivery.
*: Came to pick up husband's meds in drive through 10 minutes before they are supposed to close for lunch. The pharmacy tech got my meds and took my bank card and driver's license and walked away without handing my meds or bank card. And walked away and went to lunch. Left me sitting waiting in the drive through. Never came back. I had to go park and go inside to customer service and ask for store manager. I explained what happened. She took me to get pharmacist which was on her lunch. She stated she was upset because I interrupted her lunch. I explained I needed my card and meds and was left in drive through. And that that was very unacceptable customer service. I called corporate of Walmart and haven't heard anything from them. I have been told they will call me.
*: First time I got yelled at. I was asking the pharmacist a question and she proceeded to yell at me saying, "You can't just come here and expect your prescription to be here every week" when all I was doing was ask her a question about the amount of the prescription and then today I'm waiting in line because they are closed for lunch but the line was so long so I waited on the side. So when the last person that was in front of me was done someone got in front of me and cut me off so I waited and then I got in front with a pharmacist and she looked at me all mad because she thought I was cutting people and I told her, "I've been here before the last person you seen. I would never call anybody off" but I'm giving her my license as I say that and then she's yelling starts yelling saying, "What do you want? You just giving me your license. What do you want?" So I'm telling her I want my prescription.
*: I have been getting my medications from Walmart pharmacy store no. 1998 Skokie IL. for more than 5 years, always I am having a great service from this pharmacy and they treat my like I am the most important patient. The pharmacists and the technicians are very kind, friendly and professional. I really appreciate their help and concerns.
*: Pharmacists at my local Walmart take a personal interest in my health. They take time to discuss my prescriptions and health issues with me especially if they sense a problem. Most every pharmacy associate is knowledgeable and caring. I'd stand in line there any day rather than deal with an impersonal online pharmacy.
*: Not that you have much choice in who specialty prescriptions are processed through, but they are awful. My wife's employer just switched to them 1/1/21. I have had the same call at least 4 times over and over again to get my needed injection in time. I am told it is being processed just to get repeat calls about the same thing days later. I WAS PROMISED IT WOULD BE DELIVERED TO DOCTOR TUESDAY. Just got called again today Thursday to process meaning it will not be there on time. Lackadaisical and no concern about the health impact of this needed shot. Said it was held up for $5 co-pay that by the way we authorized and provided information for twice previously. Not looking forward to dealing with these knuckleheads every 12 weeks.
*: My insurance only reimbursed specialty drugs through them, so I had to fill here for about 2 years. Every month you have to call in and speak to a rep who transfers you to a pharmacist who second guesses the doctor’s prescription. Sometimes you have to get your prescription resent because they do not keep good records of what happened in months prior. Then you get transferred back to the reps who rehash everything like you did not just spend an hour on the phone and schedule delivery. No other pharmacy is this bureaucratic and incompetent.
*: WalMart is huge but still their pharmacy workers treat you like you are the most important patient, getting the right meds to you on time and at the best price.
*: I love the lower priced medications compared to many other pharmacies. Usually have medications in stock and quick and friendly service.
*: I switched from one pharmacy to Walmart years ago and have been with this pharmacy ever since. The customer service is wonderful. The prices have been very affordable now on most of my meds.
*: Prompt, courteous, informative and supportive. I always feel welcome. Even though they might be very busy, I always feel like they listen and care about my well being.
*: Everyone in Huntsville AR Walmart are so friendly and helpful. As soon as I walk up someone is coming to the register to help me. They ask questions and give me information on my prescriptions.
*: The pharmacist tells me whether it would be a good time to get various vaccinations, based on the prescriptions I'm filling that day. In addition to having low prices, the staff cares about customers.
*: Very kind, professional pharmacist at our Northport, Alabama Walmart location. My husband and I are retired and on a limited income. They care for us and watch out for us regarding our medications.
*: Wal-Mart pharmacies offer reduced prices for Military Retired (me). They are easy to locate, offer fast service, and will even call you when your prescription needs refilled (if you want).
*: Walmart has discounted me and my family when we need our medicine sometimes when I did not have enough money at the time to pay. Walmart has great service.
*: I am very pleased that my local WalMart Pharmacy takes part in a program with a brand name drug that I take on a daily basis. If they did not do that, I would have a difficult time obtaining it.
*: I like Walmart Pharmacy because they are always friendly, professional, and they also have curbside pickup which is very helpful. I have never had a problem with Walmart pharmacy.
*: They're very flexible; they'll send text when your RX is ready to be filled & ask if you want it filled now or later. Also if you're out of town they'll transfer your script to a store close by.
*: Often the least expensive, but sometimes a hassle. Door near pharmacy is locked so you have to walk all the way around the store to get to pharmacy. Some techs are nice, other not very friendly.
*: I have had mostly a good experience. Usually it's cheapest and not as slow as some of the others not many times I have had any issues.
*: I like Walmart pharmacy because the pharmacists and the cashiers are very friendly. If you have a question they are very polite. If you can not find something they will come out from behind the counter.
*: Walmart has cheaper medications through my insurance, however the lines are really long sometimes. I do like the drive-through option but again the lines sometimes are long.
*: Walmart is a good pharmacy but many times people are very busy and lines are longer. They go to lunch and close the doors and we have to wait for them to come back. Since that experience I never order.
*: I use Walmart Pharmacy for all of my prescription needs. I find the techs to be knowledgeable and friendly. The pharmacies is always available to answer any questions I might have without a long wait.
*: My local Walmart pharmacy staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. They always provide practical suggestions when picking up a script. They always ask about the family and make you feel special.
*: I called and wanted to transfer my prescription from one location to another, I felt like I was a bother to the woman on the phone, who didn't give me a time, and when I got there over an hour later and was speaking with the pharmacist the women next to her jumped in and once again gave her attitude. The ONLY reason I use Walmart pharmacy is because Walgreens no longer accepts my insurance. The prescriptions are NEVER ready when they say that they will be. Very disappointed! I would rather change my insurance company than to continue to use Walmart!
*: I have all of my prescriptions filled at Walmart Pharmacy. They call and email me when they are running low or ready to pick up. Prices there are the best around and service is great.
*: Family member had hospital stay; when returning home, stop to fill scripts. Those folks at my Walmart Pharmacy took care of me. Made sure I knew about scripts for my family member. They are Great!
*: My local Wal-Mart Pharmacist are difficult to get a hold of. They do not call back, so it's really hard to get a hold of the prescription. Dealing with this made me consider RX by mail.
*: The pharmacists thoroughly explain all medications and how to use. If I have additional questions they answer them and will research to be entirely sure. I've had immunizations, too.
*: The price is right. They are helpful in giving advice. They provide vaccinations and make it easy to get them. Usually, wait times are relatively short.
*: I love using my Walmart Pharmacy. They make it easy to call in to do a prescription refill and usually have the prescriptions I need in stock. Thank you Walmart Pharmacy.
*: My prescriptions are always ready when promised. It only takes a day or two to get any thing that is not in stock. All personnel are professional and friendly. Several even address me by name.
*: I meant to give them a five-star rating previously. Great Pharmacy. Like how the pharmacist comes and talks to you when you have a new medication. That way you can talk to him/her about your allergies.
*: I have always been satisfied with the service at Wal-mart pharmacy. Friendly staff, comfortable wait times and always quality meds.
*: The check out experience is normally good at the Walmart Pharmacy. Sometimes there is a line and they never open a second register.
*: Always friendly, in person or on the phone. Good to check medicines and costs- or see if doctor will renew subscription if no refills.
*: Wal-Mart's prices are cheaper. They have good technicians and the pharmacist goes over your medications with you before you check out.
*: When I ran out of my BP meds, Walmart Pharmacy in Bellmead, Texas they gave me enough to last until they could fill my prescription. Great pharmacy!
*: Nice, attentive, respectful, However I have to continually check meds to make sure getting correct generic, their system doesn't allow for notes, reminders.
*: Good prices but too much turnover of staff, many times they didn't have what I needed, and too long to get it. Wait time too long.
*: Walmart is everywhere. They are quite well staffed. If I am in Ohio, they can fill the Rx. My home store is in Casa Grande. Fast, knowledgeable people. Got my Rx in El Centro, even!
*: Pharmacist is very personable and I’ve grown to trust his knowledge and expertise when changing prescriptions or when I have questions about any medications I’m taking.
*: No one can match Walmart's pharmacy prices. Plus with the walmart app you can renew your prescriptions, prepay for them and bypass the line to pick them up.
*: I'm alerted when my prescriptions are ready by text to my phone which makes it very convenient. When I arrive, the customer service is top drawer. The pharmacists and their assistants are courteous.
*: I’ve been using Walmart pharmacy for several years now and I have never had a problem with them. I also get my annual flu vaccine. I am on Medicare now and pay very little for my meds.
*: Our experience with the pharmacy usually include waiting for a prescription. Even if this is simply a pickup there is usually a wait involved. There have been times of pricing inaccuracies.
*: Walmart's customer service is impeccable, their pharmacists take time out to speak with you about any concerns, and their costs are lowest under any insurance.
*: Very good pharmacy. The only issue was having to wait for almost a week for them to actually get the medication that was prescribed. The pharmacist was very thorough with reviewing the medication.
*: The pharmacists are knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful. I asked them numerous questions and they do their best to answer as thoroughly as possible, with options of other products.
*: I love Wal-Mart pharmacy because of the price of prescriptions plus they readily take Good RX without any problems. Almost always my meds are available.
*: Walmart in my neighborhood is very slow to get pen needles. But I found that if I go to the neighborhood Walmart in Sugarland they would accommodate me. I don't understand that.
*: They've always worked with me getting my meds done, customer service is the best. They order ahead so I don't have to wait. Great delivery service.
*: I love the early hours for seniors because of covid-19. And they have been much more responsive in the new procedures they've implemented to address that. Their text messaging follow-up has been great.
*: Great service, reminders of when prescriptions are due, they will FedeX your prescriptions if desired at no charge, drive through service, they will call your doctor if a prescription has expired.
*: I pick up my husband’s prescriptions at the Walmart pharmacy every month. When I called in for refills or inquire about Physician’s sending the prescription over, the pharmacists are polite. Kind.
*: I've never had a problem with my local Walmart pharmacy. They've always worked with me and helped me when my doctor overbooks himself and it's hard to get an appointment with him.
*: I would choose Wal-Mart 10 times over. Their $4 program has saved me thousands over the years. Wal-Mart employee was the first to tell me about DrugRX to help me save when I lost my insurance.
*: It's just easy to use and often inexpensive. I always go to Walmart for something from food to clothes to oil changes, so why not get my medicine. But honestly I can't afford to go to the doctor.
*: Walmart does not have a drive thru pharmacy nor do they offer home delivery. Often times you stand in line 20 minutes or more to pick up a prescription as they only have one person at the desk.
*: Walmart pharmacist was very helpful & patient when I called to see if they had the drugs I needed & if they took the RX card-Since I had no insurance. She went out of her way to help me.
*: My Pharmacist is very cognizant of my needs, quick to warn me about interactions and special instructions. They fill my prescriptions very quickly and the prices are great.
*: They are fast, efficient, and friendly. Not only that, they have managed customer and employee safety during the virus outbreak exceptionally well!
*: The Pharmacist is great. Very professional and knowledgeable. Has a great personality and seems to care about his clients.
*: They open late. They put back medicine early. There will be a half dozen workers chatting while only one works. They don't care about customers at all. I wish my insurance worked elsewhere.
*: I have been getting my prescriptions from Walmart for over a year now and I have had great service from them. The only thing that happens is it does take a little longer than it should do to complete.
*: Walmart has been my pharmacy for years. The pharmacy staff are very efficient and caring also very informative on the medications. And they're also very reasonable.
*: I never have any problems or issues at Walmart. The pharmacist is available to answer questions. If there is any possible interactions with other medications they let you know.
*: I’ve used Walmart for far too long. Quite a few times they are out of my medication. I had to wait. Now I’m going to use CVS since my Ins. Co prefers CVS. I have to see my doctors to change scripts.
*: Since I do not have insurance I must watch every penny that goes out the door. Sam's prices are a lifesaver! I use them for everything including vaccinations. The staff is tops in the industry!
*: I was forced to switch pharmacies when I was put on Medicaid. I was very disheartened. The only pharmacy that carries my medication is Wal-Mart in my town. I had used them before and didn't like them. One pharmacist literally hit on my husband when he went to get my script twice! The medication is always old. It has No snap to it. ** and any pill when fresh or kept right should snap and be fresh. I would get my script and it would crumble when I went to snap it in half. I mean crumble into pieces! No snap. Also when I took it and take it now it has lost potency. I'm literally laying on the couch like I took nothing. Very annoying. The sad thing is I'm stuck with these old pills all month! I had this problem then years ago and have this problem now all over again.
*: I am quarantined in Nh but usually live in MA. The Walmart pharmacy would not mail me my prescription even though we are in a PANDEMIC and on lockdown. So, after pulling teeth, and a ton of reps who "didn't have any answers", I have it sent to a NH location, and then, the walmart in NH almost tripled the cost of the prescription. Walmart does not care that we are on lockdown and is making it impossible for me to get a much needed medication. My only option at this point is to pay 3x the amount for it. Greedy disgusting thing to do to people during a pandemic when they know most of us are out of jobs. WOW. GREAT JOB WALMART.
*: Hello all, I am posting a different kind of review about my pharmacy here.... I use Walmart Pharmacy for my prescriptions, and have asked them repeatedly to stop having an automated robo call sent to me every time I request a refill, but they will not do so. Despite the fact that every single time I contact the pharmacy, and ask to be removed from this feature.
*: I go out of my way to go to this Wal-Mart but the action of the pharmacy today has left me outdone! At 4:48, I received a message that the COUGH medicine I have been waiting for since Thursday, because given that COVID-19 is primarily a COUGH, Wal-Mart, a pharmacy that I go to because I can get medicine there for less than 1/4 what it costs, with insurance, at the nearest pharmacy, let the COUGH MEDICINE supply run out, knowing, because they told me so when I called, that there would not be another delivery for 5 days. 
*: I called Wal-Mart Pharmacy customer service this morning to find out about your prescription medicine delivery service because I am disabled and my family is in the high risk category for COVID-19. I got the rep on the phone and asked her about this and she said I had to call my insurance company and then my doctor so they can set up an account, which is fine, but the script has already filled, and is waiting at the store. I just needed it delivered. So I asked her what I could do to get it today.
*: Through with Walmart Pharmacy. Lately my medications are on backorder more and more frequently. Even common medications such as blood pressure medicine. Now I have developed shingles in my right eye. Eye Dr called in a prescription eye gel. Now, this is serious, I could suffer permanent damage to my eye if not treated soon enough. It's now been 5 days since my prescription order was placed. They say it is on backorder. I was lucky enough that the Dr. had a couple of samples, but she gave me the last two and I only have enough for today's dosage. I don't believe this "backorder" excuse. It's walmart, they are not willing to employ enough people to get the job done. That being said I intend to call them today and tell them to just transfer that $474 medication to CVS.
*: I dropped off 3 prescription on Tuesday 01/21/20, two were filled, one did have a diagnosis code. The third one they said had no diagnosis code. So I called the doctor office. The pharmacy said they faxed the doctor office. So Wednesday I called the doctor office left message. Thursday I called the doctor office left message. Friday I called the doctor office. Explained the issue. So I finally got through. They called the pharmacy with the diagnosis code. Now I go online to check status. Medication not in stock. We will contact you in 1 to 2 days, that was Friday. Today is Sunday 01/26/20. Now wouldn't you think they would order the medication prior to Friday.
*: After my first visit to a Pain Clinic, I took a prescription to Walmart for a narcotic. I’ve taken narcotics before after surgeries and I’ve never had problems before. When I’m not in pain, I just don’t take pain medicine. Walmart’s pharmacy staff made me feel like a junkie with all the questions about what it was for and why I went to that particular pain clinic! They initially sent the prescription back to me by my husband after I was told on the phone, by the pharmacist, that he would fill it and after he or somebody wrote back pain on my actual prescription.
*: Took my script in to be filled, the woman tech said she could fill my script, all the while looking at her computer. She told me to come back in an hour. When I went back in two hours she handed me my script and said she could not fill it. This woman is playing God as there were enough meds to fill my script. She is rude and talks down to people. Many complaints have been lodged against her to the now departed Pharmacist who was demoted and relocated.
*: I am so unhappy about the service and attitudes of the staff and pharmacists at this store. Last month I took a prescription in for a cough medicine that they said was a narcotic and the pharmacist "chose" to not fill it. She said that the other pharmacists would, but she personally chose to not fill narcotics for this doctor (from a reputable, local doctor). Who is she to decide who to fill prescriptions for? I took in a prescription yesterday for something I have been on for 10 year, but the dosage had changed. It was a printed prescription on the doctor's form. They acted like I was a criminal and wouldn't fill it without verifying with the doctor that it was legitimate.
*: My insurance last year eliminated the over 20 year satisfied use of my previous pharmacy leaving me with limited options. Walmart Pharmacy in Brockport NY is what I was left with in my town and it has been an insufferable nightmare since with a few exceptions that allowed me to give it an additional star. It is so bad. Just thinking of going there gives me such extreme anxiety and they rarely fail to deliver on the causes of that. Last night put me over the edge. There have been all too many incidents of their slothingly ways of dealing with lines which indicates how little value they have for consumer's time. They get chatty with the customers with long lines making the wait exponentially long over extraneous non essential drivel they placate other customers with. This is fine if there are not others waiting. If there is a line the staff need to move the customers they are with along. Alert them that they need to take the next customer. 
*: I went to pick up my prescription to Walmart Pharmacy in Norwich, CT. The young girl who assisted me was EXTREMELY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. Even the pharmacist gentleman said something to her. When I went back 15 minutes later she was making loud comments about trying to be nice to customers. To what the cashier told her that she needed to be nice. I found it very unprofessional and the fact that people like her are all allowed to work with customers is a shame. I blame this on the manager. I will be taking my business somewhere else where I'm treated with respect.
*: This is a review of the Walmart Pharmacy on South 31th street in Temple, Tx. This place is constantly slow in filling prescriptions, even when called in on the phone. On the morning of September 27 my wife called in a refill and was told it would be ready Saturday after lunch. We check in to pick up the prescription and are told it will be ready in 20 minutes. This is 29 hours after being ordered. Then they close for lunch. After lunch we check in again. We are told it would be 30 minutes. I said, "Bull, that's what you said 45 minutes ago." Response, "We had lunch." My reply was, "Tough, we have better things to do than spend all afternoon in a Walmart store." The prescription was ready in five minutes.. We are taking our business elsewhere.
*: I ordered 3 pills for a cat. The vet was called 8 times by different people, the vet people are returning calls, I called vet because I kept getting notifications that the pharmacy could not get through to them or get a call back, I get told by the vet that they are returning calls. Then, pharmacy tells me they'll try again. I had already cancelled the whole thing to try another place, I tell the pharmacy I cancelled my order and deleted my card. Then, I call to ask about a paper rx. Can't do that, but get told the original order went through, was shipped. How if I cancelled and removed my card information? In fact, I get the order, and my card is charged. HOW? I can't remove my profile and I want it removed. I get the 3 pills, from a Agropet Trading LLC address Miami Lakes, FL., same address as walmartpetrx.com. Agropet is a 3 person firm. associated with Allivet.com, a site exactly like Walmartpetrx.com. What the is going on here???
*: We ordered our dogs prescription medicine from Walmart RX and paid an additional $22 for overnight shipping. Two days later the order still had not shipped. I called Walmart and they said they faxed the order for approval twice but received no response from our vet. I called our vet and they have received no fax requesting approval for the medicine. A professional pharmacy should follow up when they are unable to reach a Veterinarian office via fax instead of letting the ball drop on their customers.
*: I called to check on an item and was on hold for 6 minutes, eventually called back and was rudely told by the pharmacist Mary that if I hang up, "You'll just wait even longer and put back on hold again." So far it's another 7 minutes. If this is SERVICE you can keep it. Call eventually took a total of 18 minutes after 2 holds of 6 and 8 minutes and then I get all the ** about, "Well we just came back from lunch and there's only 3 of us." DO I CARE??!! I think Walmart makes PLENTY of profit. Maybe they need to spend some on improving CUSTOMER (yes we are the ones who pay) SERVICE.
*: What happen to my card, I file a police report. I called Walmart corporate and they all agree that they saw me put the card inside the slot but after that it just vanished. As one walmart corporate employee puts it, like magically vanishes. I look at the employee do something then look strange ask that I put my card in after she pull the slot in and my card went missing. I was assured that the machine must have eaten it although it would be the first time because the card was just gone. 
*: Per my request and my prescription insurance coverage, my doctor writes 90-day scripts. On two occasions Walmart #3990 has not filled the scripts as written. On the first occasion, 3 months ago, I noticed before I left the store. It was corrected and I advised that in the future they should issue the item as the doctor had written the script for. Last week I did not notice until I got home. This time it was for a non drug item and has no chance of inappropriate use. The item comes in boxes of 100 and the doctor wrote it for 200 items total, which would last the required 90 days +10. I wrote a letter a week ago and have not received a response. One 90-day scripts are less expense than 30 day scripts and I don’t have to drive the 60 miles round trip to retrieve as often.
*: These people treat you as if you committing a crime when you need a RX filled for narcotic type medications. They have gone so far as reviewing all of my medications before filling my RX. This last time was it! The pharmacist refused to fill my RX the way it was written by my orthopedic surgeon. She stated they were giving me too much. I literally just had joint supplement surgery. Who do they think they are to second guess my doctor? Not only that, they talk down to you and treat you as if you are a criminal or a strung out drug addict. I will never use Walmart Pharmacy again!
*: There needs to be a ZERO stars option! This is the Walmart Pharmacy on Debarr Rd, Anchorage Alaska. Pharmacy experience was horrible! (Backstory: my adult son had oral surgery, first surgery in his life). Drove to this pharmacy knowing it would take time to fill. Had to take him because of identification and insurance. #1 I was told 20-25 minutes. There is one Pharmacist (D) and 3 pharmacy techs working. We go grab post-surgical foods and items to make recovery easier/more tolerable. Give them extra time (50 minutes).
*: Been filling my **, ** and ** through Walmart for over two years now... Every month. Without ANY warning, last minute, they can no longer fill "controlled substances prescribed by my doctor", and of course no further reasoning could be provided. I still don't know if it's because of me, if it's only controlled substances by my Doc, or if they've blacklisted my Doc altogether. These pharmacists know full well that a sudden stop in a benzodiazepine will cause seizures and other serious side effects, including DEATH. Thanks for the heads up! Literally giving me no time to communicate with my doctor until last minute. Going 3 days without ** and ** will more than likely kill a person, so thank you for that... ** YOU! TAKING MY BUSINESS TO WALGREENS!
*: This is for the Walmart Pharmacy in Manchester MO. I dropped off 4 prescriptions all on one paper. I was going to pick them up in a few days. I called to check on them today and was told they do not have the prescriptions! I am absolutely livid! I went to them because they have the cheapest prices but I would go elsewhere to get more professional, less irresponsible.
*: Wife had a heart attack. Prescribed ** for pain after surgery. Walmart pharmacy in Charleston Illinois wouldn't fill the prescription because my wife also uses this medicine for arthritis. Her heart doctor knows this and prescribed it. Walmart pharmacist has more knowledge than a heart surgeon, family doctor, critical care nurse, or anyone else with a medical degree. That is what they think is true. I took the prescription to another pharmacy, and it was filled without question.
*: The "high on her own horse" pharmacist needs to be fired. She's mean, and unprofessional. And if you "refused" to fill my script, WHY didn't you call me??? Too busy not trying to drown in this rainy weather with your nose stuck WAY too high up.. It's rainin' lady.. Hope you don't melt! Actually wish you would!
*: Okay I've had the same medicine and dose for over 12 years and because some person checks the wrong box, I have to wait. You owe me money! My time is valuable! Please stick your policy and procedure up. And send me a check for 100 dollars for my time. Geez sick of this! Get a release form for the customer. Some of us are medical persons and don't need your spiel. Matter of fact the pharmacist just let me go one week and didn't do his job of policies!!!
*: Don't know what they are doing. Pharmacy Cynthiana Ky. My Dr called in 4 prescriptions and they ran none of them through my insurance. Told me one was going to be 295.00 with my insurance, funny thing is the cash cost of this drug is 300.00 meaning insurance company only will pay 5???? So I called back and said I can't pay that, so I was told then it was 69.00 with my insurance, called my Dr back and told him to send a generic in pill form as I could not afford to pay for these medications and then called the insurance company to complain and was told they ran none of them through the insurance. Called Walmart back and told them and they said, "Oh yeah, we thought you wanted the CASH PRICE." Really!!!! So then ran it though insurance and was told my copay was zero. OMG. It's like pulling teeth to get things filled at that pharmacy.
*: Went in to pick up my RX for antibiotics. Was informed they were in the process of filling it, but would be going to lunch soon, and I would have to wait an hour and a half for it to be ready. Every experience I've had at Walmart Pharmacy has been poor. The staff are rude and show little to no compassion for the patients and their needs. They will NEVER go out of their way to make your experience easier. It is clear that they simply do not care about the people in front of them. In the past I have chosen Walmart simply because the costs are lower than other pharmacies, but Walmart has officially lost my business. I would rather pay a little more at a pharmacy that cares about their patients and treats them with the respect they deserve.
*: The pharmacist refused to come off break to dispense post-surgical painkillers, causing a medical emergency. She is now under investigation by the Virginia Board of Pharmacy for violating the Controlled Substances Act and gross negligence.
*: Because of past experiences at WalMart's Pharmacy (nearly 15 years), I always call ahead to make sure my mom's prescriptions are ready for pickup before going to pick them up. I renewed 3 of her prescriptions by phone on a Friday afternoon knowing that as new prescriptions were needed from the doctor's office it would likely be Monday late before they were available. 
*: The prices are good, but it's wait, wait, and wait some more. Even if my doctor calls in the prescription and I wait to pick it up until the next day, it's a long wait. I have tried the online refill, same thing. You should be able to walk in, pick it up and pay and be done. Now if I take a new prescription in and leave it at the window, I expect a wait, but if they say 30 mins, I do not expect to return and be told another 30 minutes.
*: Used Wal-Mart for nearly a year, go to doctor every 3 months for checkup, and prescription refills. I take 3 meds. My family doctor would fax them to Wal-Mart and I would call and inform them I would come next day to pick up meds. I went 4 times in a year, and not 1 time did they ever have my prescriptions filled even after 24 hours. But 2 of the times they didn't my blood pressure medicine in stock and I would have to wait 2 days for them to get it in stock in order to fill my prescription. I have used CVS, Walgreens with no problems, always filled within an hour. I now use a pharmacy in the same strip mall where my family doctor is located, they walk the prescription over to the pharmacy and usually 15 minutes they have them filled. It is a little more expensive than CVS or Walgreens, but it's 15 miles one way to these name brand pharmacies. So with time and gas, it's more convenient to use a small local pharmacy.
*: Walmart is notorious, for crappie customer service. This includes waiting in line for your pharmacy prescriptions. And then you get up there to cashier to find out it's not ready, they have put it on hold?! What?! So now you have to wait again. Only one cashier?! With 15 people in line?! I hate Walmart.
*: Walmart prices are good, but are constantly changing going up and down. The clerks are usually slow and rude. They will text and say the order is ready and once you drive all the way over there it’s not ready. They even have to call the Dr. I would switch but it’s close to home.
*: This rating is primarily for WAL-MART'S MAIL ORDER PHARMACY. WAL-MART'S $10 for 90 day program has ALWAYS come out a bit ahead of the co-pays I would've paid through my two different insurers, that I had to choose from, for my maintenance medication. I've used the MAIL ORDER SERVICE from one state to another, during a sudden temporary address change and flawlessly my VERY NECESSARY medication followed without a hiccup in time. A+++
*: I have 3 of the pharmacist on first name basically. Due to all my medical reactions to medicines they kind me safe. Every time I refill a script they make sure I take right by discussing it and if I had any issues that may occur by taking it They call the remind me to reorder my scripts so I don't ever run out. They are easy to get to with a drive through I a life saver due to my walking disability. I love my marketplace.
*: The staff is very knowledgeable, polite and courteous. Have never had an issue since we switched about 8 months ago from Rexall which was terrible. When we were with Rexall it got to the point that we would have to wait sometimes 3-4 days for a prescription. Since switching to Wal-Mart. We can drop off a prescription when we enter the store and pick it up within 1/2 to 3/4 of an hour.
*: If my insurance did not mandate that I use this pharmacy, I wouldn't. The old manager Cam was great. He retired and so did their quality. It's bad enough to have to wait for a prescription, but when I've called it in 2 days prior and I still have to wait - that's ridiculous.
*: Wal-Mart Pharmacy in Brunswick Troy NY, is about the greatest pharmacy ever. Jeff and the new young lady pharmacists are so accommodating. No matter how much you call with a question they are more than happy to answer and take their time with you. Would go nowhere else.
*: My pharmacist at Walmart are always friendly and are very knowledgeable. They are my go to folks for info and trust in a medicine. I can ask their advice on OTC drugs as well as prescriptions. They always take the time to know you fully understand. I have always been satisfied with my Walmart pharmacy in Unicoi Tn.
*: We just had to change to Wal-Mart Pharmacy beginning Jan. 1, 2019. So far our initial start up and getting prescriptions transferred has been anything but pleasant. The help cannot seem to get their "act together" with all the information given them and put it into motion. I am hoping that as a few more months pass, things will be better. I do know that the prices we are getting from Wal-Mart are 150 percent better than the prices we got from the independent pharmacy we had used for years. One on prescription alone saved us over three fourths as much as we had been paying. That is very welcomed. So due to the money factor, we will continue to trade at Wal-Mart Pharmacy and pray things improve.
*: I went to Walmart in Memphis Tennessee on Austin Peay Highway. I went to the pharmacy and asked for my ** insulin. The girls saw me waiting and were in no hurry to wait on me. Finally one of them opened the refrigerator, took out a bottle and put it in a sack and handed it to me. You pay for it right then so I put it in my purse got home and put it in my refrigerator. The next day I got it out and looked at it, it was not what I asked for and paid for. I went back to Walmart to get told it was my fault for not looking at it before I walked away and they said no exchange or money back.
*: I was told that my prescription was a Maintenance issue and wasn't a priority, I shouldn't have ran out and since I had, they weren't going to fill it until the next day. I said what since when can you prioritize whose medication you want to fill? Then she said that you can call another store if you want your medicine. I had to call Seagoville pharmacy and they were Ashamed of Kaufman!!! I was so upset that I called back, spoke with store asst manager she went over and said something. Meanwhile mysteriously my prescriptions were ready WITH AN APOLOGY! SAVE YOUR APOLOGIES...YOUR PHARMACY SUCK...AND SO DO YOUR EMPLOYEES...
*: First of all I despise Walmart. I have been waiting all afternoon for a refill on my pain medication. Doctor called in and because it's a controlled substance they can only give me enough for a week. They finally told me this at 8:00pm and I've been in pain all day. Knee replacement. CVS here I come. Also, I admire foreigners who speak our language. I can't theirs. But, please please hire those that speak more clearly.
*: I recently broke a tooth and went to Walmart to have a prescription filled for a pain pill because a tooth was hurting me very badly. I waited for 2 and 1/2 hours in pain, for them to fill my prescription just for them to tell me that they were completely out of my pain medication.
*: My husband was given a 30 day script from the doctor for a recurring back injury. He went to the Walmart Pharmacy to fill said script. They called him when it was filled with a price of $31.00. Then, he gave them the insurance information. Walmart tech told him that he could only fill a 7 day script. Walmart policy, they said. We explained that the doctor wrote the script for 30 days. We then called the insurance company. They said that the script is covered for 30 days; but, Krishna (the pharmacist) decided to only fill 7 days and the other 21 days would be lost. In other words, go back to the doctor for another script. 
*: I have been filling prescriptions at Walmart for years. This time last year, I refilled an available prescription online, got the email saying they were filling it, and then went to pick it up, and they said they had no record of the prescription or me requesting to fill it. After a few frustrated calls to my insurance and the pharmacy themselves, I ended up requesting the doctor's office to send a refill to the pharmacy. No problems again, until today. 
*: I never get my prescriptions filled at Walmart but considering ** is a one time fill and I was at Walmart shopping I decided to drop my prescription off and have it filled while I shopped. Well that was a mistake. 1st of all it took a lot longer to fill than they originally said so I said I would come back and get it tomorrow. Well I ended up in the hospital for almost a week and then for another week after that was having a hard time recuperating and did not go anywhere. I called Walmart pharmacy once I was feeling better and they said they had restocked my prescription because it had been more than 9 days and they would have to refill it. When I went to get it the pharmacist told me that because it was a narcotic and it was a first time fill I would only get 7 days' supply and in the process of waiting for the rest of my prescription they would be calling my doctor to make sure that I should have this prescription. 
*: I recently moved an hour away from the Walmart where I had my scripts for years. I have severe RA and for 5 months now have been dealing with a very aggressive anterolateral impingement of the left knee for which I received a very minimal narcotic script of only 20 tablets. I didn't even require the medicine but every couple of months, from the Same physician and the same exact strength and dosage. When I moved I transferred my scripts from one Walmart store to another, and as everyone knows they all use the same computer records.
*: I had the first shingles vaccine in Sept at Walmart. They said I should get the second shot in two months. Went back over and over and they said they didn't have the second vaccine but would call me when it gets in. I received a letter from Walmart saying I needed to go and get the second shot which is needed within 2-6 months from second shot. It has been 4 months. I went in today with the letter and they said they had the second shot. Since it was Jan 2 - my prescription insurance started over and they said I would have to pay 3 times as much as I did on the first one. I asked them if they had this shot for awhile and they said they did. They didn't call me and I could have gotten the shot at the price of the first one. Since I am on a strict budget, I was not able to get the shot today. Evidently they won't be getting any more until August and so getting the first shot was a waste for me because without the second shot it does not protect.
*: Pharmacy closes 6pm. Urgent care doctor rushed us out so that we can fill prescription before pharmacy closes. He apparently knew it closes at that time. Got to window at 5:36pm but was told to come back tomorrow because it was too late! REALLY! She was very rude & unapologetic still after pleading my case telling her my wife was in a lot of pain (had just broken a foot). She didn't care. Her response, "take your prescription to CVS". I did do that. The next morning the pharmacist there filled it in 10 minutes! Boycotting Walmart pharmacy!
*: Hwy 31 Hartselle, AL 35640 - I came in with a prescription for **. The line on the prescription subtitled Substitution Permitted was signed. Nonetheless they wanted to charge $29 for **, rather than $4 for the substitute ** which is on the $4 list. I took the bus and the round trip ended up taking about 2 hours. I won't do that again.
*: Every month they treat me like crap as soon as they see what I'm filling. They refused to fill it in till I showed them my MRI. In front of everybody I felt so embarrassed and violated. Everyone around me was listening. They have the biggest attitudes then keep changing rules. I can't fill over 120. They never never have it so I have to go elsewhere. Guess what. Next month they tell me I can't do that. I have to wait a week till they get theirs in. I called my Dr. and pharmacy board. Both told me, "As long as you are on time you have every right to go to who has your meds. You could die if you abruptly stop taking those meds." Think they care. They don't care to help, offer a solution. Just act like, "What? You can't wait a week in pain?" Don't dare ask anything. The pharmacist was name Jade **. NV. My Dr got her fired but I'm sure all they did was move her to another store. She should not be at any. Everybody on pain relief is not a drug addict.
*: Last month I stopped at the closest Walmart to drop off my prescription to be filled as I was leaving town. Waited 20 minutes then the pharmacist calls me over & says he called my pain management dr and he didn’t know I was being prescribed **. I told him that was untrue because I’m drug tested every 3-4 months. He also said something about needing a diagnosis code for why I take. Luckily I took my prescription back, went to both of the drs involved and was told by the pain dr all his patient's meds were not being filled even with diagnosis. I took it to the Walmart I have been using since they opened and it was filled in 10 minutes. Fast forward a month. Yesterday I called to get my ** refill because it wasn’t showing up online. I had picked it up in November and had 2 refills. I was ask when I needed it and I said a couple of days will be fine. 
*: I have used Walmart for yrs. This week the Pharm refused to fill my Rx until he rec'd the diagnosis from the MD. Note they have been filling same dose for last 5 mos. No consideration of withdrawal, no assessment of symptoms. My MD basis my medication doses on not just my Rx, but also my symptoms. He refused to ever fill a script for me again because I asked him if he would just start writing my scripts. Why pay for MD visit if pharmacist can do it?
*: I have been to multiple Walmart Pharmacies to fill my prescriptions. I've been very upfront about needing my medication to be name brand and not the generic versions. The generic version they give me is so bad that I might as well not be taking it at all. My scripts have the DAW order specially written on it by my physician. Walmart continuously ignores this order and my requests. I'm afraid if I don't accept the generic medication they try to give me instead, I won't be able to get my script back and will be left without medication of any kind. The one time I checked my medication during the consult and brought up the DAW order, I was told I had to take the generic version or I was not getting any medication and not getting my script back. I don't know what to do at this point. I may need to start videotaping the entire interaction even though I find this incredibly annoying and rude to do to somebody.
*: Walmart pharmacy Homosassa Fl is a nightmare. Current example for antibiotic called in by my Doctor. First claimed she never called in this med - I have her voicemail confirming the time & location she did phone RX, second I had the on-call Dr call back to get this antibiotic - they claimed they rec'd the call but could not fill RX because they didn’t get the Doctor's first name??!! WTH. Third - just called. Pharmacist glibly replies “NOPE, no antibiotic has been filled“. On my way to the ER!
*: I've been a regular customer of the main store for years, my parents have been Rx customers their entire lives - a few weeks ago I went to pick up my mom's prescriptions for her. She has crippling arthritis and can't get around well, so she needed me to pick them up. Not only did they not have her scripts ready, but they had NO record of the phone call that they had made the week prior telling her she needed a refill. And then the pharmacist argued that she had no prescriptions ready and that everything related to her pain and mental health were too soon to fill. 
*: I have been filling my family's prescriptions since the opening of the Fairfax, VA Walmart and we get my husband's 5 heart medications, my asthma medication and my dogs degenerative old age medications. We spend over $1000 per month at the Fairfax Walmart. My husband went this evening to fill a prescription my dentist wrote at 4:00 PM and the pharmacist respectfully told him he would not fill the prescription and would not tell him why. This is both an inconvenience and a negative shopping experience.
*: Up until 3 months ago, I have had no issues filling my prescriptions at the Wal-Mart in Cookeville, TN. Suddenly, they are refusing to fill them. They stated they needed to know "WHY" I took one of my medications. I explained... In front of other customers in a public setting, which is uncalled for. Then they said they needed to speak to my Dr. to verbally hear why and verify the rx with them. They called, my Dr. verified I have a degenerative issue in my spine and have been on controlled low doses of pain medication to allow normal function. I also cash pay for my medication, however they tried to advise I need a prior authorization. To which I asked if I am Cash paying, no insurance, how was I supposed to get a PA? One week later, 39 phone calls and a complaint filed with Wal-Mart corporate and I was able to receive my medication.
*: I am a new customer at the Geer Rd, Walmart in Turlock, I recently changed insurance and was advised to use them. My Doctor sent 3 new Rxs in. Two were filled. One was not my pain meds. When I went to pick up my Rxs I was first told that it was too soon for the pain med to be filled. I advised that it was a new one and past due. I was sent over to discuss reason for delay. I was told that the Pharmacist thought it was a mistake and chose to not fill it. I explained that it was not an error. Then I was told they had to get the diagnosis and reason for Rx. I went back again. This I was told that it was a controlled substance and they had to call Doctor for info. I called again and was told that they had not received the info, therefore it was not filled. I explained that I was in pain and needed the meds. 
*: After 15 years of having my husband's prescriptions filled at the Walmart Pharmacy on Church Road, Kansas City. I was publicly shamed by the pharmacist on duty for his pain relief medication. He proceeded to belittle me, asking me 'what was wrong with my husband' and that 'he's on too much pain medication, he needs to go back to his doctor and get tapered'. I looked at him in shock, what gives a pharmacist the right to give medical advice? I shouldn't have, but being caught off guard, I tried to politely explain that he has a broken/fractured spine, and that if he looked at his record, he can see that my husband already has done his best to reduce his pain medication, going from three (including **) down to 1 MEDICATION! 
*: I have gone the 4436 pharmacy twice, both times the pharmacy tech cannot locate my prescription. The doctor maintains that he sent the prescription twice. The tech cannot find it. The Doctor resent while I was at the pharmacy and the tech still could not find it. The doctor's office then sent me a confirmation that they sent it to store 4436. The pharmacist on duty never wanted to get involved.
*: This review is about the Walmart pharmacy in Gardnerville, Nevada. After receiving an email saying my husband's medicine was ready to be picked up I went into the pharmacy. There was a very long line. I thought about walking out and coming back later but my husband was in the car waiting and he was in pain and needed his medicine. He has only been home from the hospital a short time. When I finally got up to the counter the clerk who was very rushed told me they didn't have any prescriptions for my husband. When I got home I called Walmart. They said that they did have a prescription ready for him. I told them what just happened when I went to pick it up and they said it must have been a computer glitch. My husband is very sick. Mistakes like these make our lives even harder. What this means is I will have to get my ill husband back in the car and run down to Walmart for a second time. 
*: On 9/24/18 I asked pharmacy if I could get my flu and pneumonia shots there at  Deptford NJ location. The pharmacist, Peter seemed confused, calling me to the front, then back then again. I had my 91 yr old mother with me, and she even noticed it was a little strange. Finally, Peter the pharmacist administered the needles straight forward into my shoulder bone, not off to the side. He commented, it had to go into the muscle and that air got in??? That was about 3pm by 6pm, my entire shoulder blew up, I was in severe pain, I called him and he said takes about 3 days take **. 
*: To be fair, my initial 2 prescription transaction with the Central Ave., Toledo, OH, Wal-Mart Pharmacy, was just fine. My recent and third experience, on Tuesday evening (10/2/18) was most unacceptable. He is my story: I called the Wal-Mart Pharmacy at 4 something p.m. on 10/2 to assure that they had received the needed prescriptions from my eye doctor. The lady affirmed the script was available, and said it would be ready for my pick-up by 6 p.m. We arrived at the pharmacy counter at 7:45, and I was told by the pleasant lady that is was not ready yet. She apologized. This cashier offered that... "we were horribly busy today". I was told to return within 15 minutes or so and also assured it would be ready then. I was admonished to return to her before the pharmacy closed at 9 p.m. I then returned a half an hour later, at which time I was informed that my prescription was ready for pick-up, and told also how much it would cost.
*: Like the reviews before me I had a very distasteful incident today. My husband was released from hospital after a full foot reconstruction. I dropped off the prescriptions and was to come back in an hour. I actually went back 3 hours later and was told they could not fill the pain pill without the doctor's verbal consent. They told me he wasn’t responding to their call. So I called the office and they paged him. After 25 minutes he responded however we had another issue. Apparently Walmart has set new guidelines and will not fill the dosage of pain pill my husband will need for his foot. 
*: Almost a year ago I went to pick up my prescription at pharmacy in Hazel Dell Vancouver Washington. As I was waiting I got talked into the flu shot and ammonia shot. Against my better judgment I still got it anyway, wish I never would’ve. The pharmacist said it ministered it. She put the desk on my arm look like a little Band-Aid with a clear window, she told me she was going to give me one shot before the other student want to hurt him more. So she gave me the first one that was supposed to hurt the worst. That was fine. No problem. She gave me the second one which I’m pretty sure it’s the flu shot and I came about 12 inches off the chair. It hurt so bad immediately and there was tingling in my fingers all the way up the back of my head and I said I didn’t feel right. Something is wrong. 
*: My doctor’s office called in a recurring medication for me. Hours later, I received no word from the pharmacy that it was ready. I called the pharmacy myself and was placed on hold. One of the ladies got on and said that although they called it in, they need to verify with them why I was taking it since I hadn’t been prescribed before. I let her know that I had and that I’ve filled it there before to which she replied “snobbish” and asked why. I let her know that they were for mouth ulcers. She asked how long had I had Them to which I told her, "For 13 years."
*: I got a text on 9/9/2018 that my prescription was ready. That was Sunday, I forgot to go on Monday 9/10/2018. The store closed because of Florence (the hurricane) 9/11/2018 until 9/16/2018. I went to pick it up and they had put it back. They didn't even wait one day before putting it back after just opening today.
*: Having used this pharmacy for years because I trusted them to charge fairly, I found out this week how wrong I was. This pharmacy is 25 miles from where I live. My daughter had picked up one of my husband's prescriptions for me on Tuesday as she was in town... I am 84 years old and my husband has only a few weeks to live. They charged her $129.45. I called the next day, explaining that I had checked in my little town of 2,000 folks and the local pharmacy would charge $27.00 for exactly the same thing! So I asked to return the one I can't really afford. They agreed, seeing as it had not even been taken out of the original WalMart bag. 
*: I never had a problem refilling my meds until today. The pharmacist was rude and told me that she did not feel comfortable refilling my rx until she spoke to my Dr. I told her that my Dr does not take pharmacy calls. She said the nurse could take care of it. I said there is no nurse. It’s just the Dr and a receptionist who is frankly dippy. I could get nowhere with the pharmacist. I have been on this medication for 10 years and now they question a refill. She would not tell me anything. I said that, "I am the patient and I have every right to know why you won’t refill my rx." I’ll call my doctor tomorrow and see if she will call Walmart. Frankly, I’m disgusted. My insurance has Walmart as a preferred provider. If I go elsewhere my cost will increase greatly.
*: I have been using Walmart for years to get my medicine. I get a call the day before which is today that I need my medicine and was told he can't fill it and I need to come pick up my script they have had on file. They have been filling the same medicine for me for almost 4 years now. I am disabled and need my medicine. I will be contacting my lawyer. You have to be weaned off this medicine. You should not be able by law to tell someone 2 days before to come get your script. I will be taken this as far as I can so no one else in my situation has to ever go through this. No one at the pharmacy could even give me a reason as to why and you cannot understand the pharmacy.
*: I have used Wal-Mart Pharmacy for literally years. However, in the last 3 months it has been a real feat getting scripts from them. First, they drug shamed me right there at the counter in front of other customers. My script is not a controlled substance, not a pain medication, etc. It was very embarrassing. It was the Friday before Memorial Day and they said they couldn't fill it until they got verification from my doctor which meant I couldn't get the refill for 3 more day, even though it was a refill for a non-controlled script. (IT may be a HIPAA violation to discuss scripts with a customer in such a manner.) Then they raised the amount of the prescriptions by 40% and told me that my healthcare company had raised the price. 
*: The pharmacies of Walmart are now requiring an additional unneeded step after purchasing a prescription. For prescriptions I have taken for years and not for narcotics. I am now being told it is required by law. I just had to wait an additional 15 minutes after the initial wait time before purchase just for the pharmacy to review my name and verify I had no questions. All of which I had already answered. His is a stupid unnecessary, time-consuming step. Why in the heck would they put this step in as they have. It is a waste and serves no purpose. I HATE Walmart Pharmacy!
*: Walmart Pharmacy and I have never had a problem till recently. They are now have me run out of my **, which is a 30 script. Now I can't get till the 31st day and have never given me a reason why! Not happy.
*: Today Walmart Corporate told me through a pharmacist that they were not going to fill any prescription for a controlled substance... I take a medication for Parkinson's along with other medications, now Walmart is stating that they feel that these medications are not going to be filled. They failed to state a reason? I believe that it is time to start fighting back against improperly informed corporate delinquents, who have no access to my medical records, do not know what my medical conditions are, have no authority to overrule a doctor in the care of my medical conditions. It is time for a class action lawsuit against companies that attempt to subvert the law including the Americans with disabilities act along with other federal laws which appear to have been violated... I would welcome any attorney to begin proceedings.
*: On 2 occasions Walmart Pharmacy has shorted my husband and I on our pain medicine. Please be aware and have them count it at the consultation area, otherwise if you leave the store they will not give you what they shorted you.
*: This review is directed at Walmart Corporation not their underpaid underappreciated employees. Walmart plays this game of charging you full price as often as they can get away with it. It doesn’t matter how recent or often you have updated your health insurance and prescription drug coverage. They will claim that the drug is not covered or that your insurance doesn’t cover it. Most likely both are lies.
*: I am a well educated person, was waiting at the pharmacy for a long time, came up that the pharmacist was waiting for the dr to call to clarify a dosage of a laxative for my baby, when I tried to ask her nicely saying if there is two doses can we go with the lower dose, once of a sudden she started screaming and talking at me saying I can’t I can’t I can’t. Everyone in line was giving me that look such as a drug addict was trying to force the pharmacist to give him something. This is not a way to talk to a customer and of course after two hours of waiting time she refused to call the pediatric office and we walked out without the medication. If you care about your time and see that you deserve some respect find another nearby pharmacy to deal with. Pharmacist’s name is: April ** at Walmart Pharmacy Tega Cay, South Carolina.
*: I am writing this review so that everyone is aware of what Walmart is doing to the people who find themselves at the end of the journey to relieve their pain and are on pain management. Not one pain management patient I have talked to desires to be where we are. Most if not all have already gone through Xrays, MRI, CAT Scans, injections, physical therapy, psychology and surgeries. We end up on pain management because there are no more treatments!!! This enables us to get out of bed in the morning, go to work to support our families or provide us with enough pain relief that we can enjoy our lives. There is no "high" that we get from pain medications... it's for pain relief only. Our pain management physician has all of our doctor reports and is very well aware of why we are sitting in their office. We do not go to them first... we go to them LAST. 
*: I am currently without insurance for a couple more months, and was told last month that Walmart would no longer be accepting discount cards for **. My doctors took me off of NSAIDs because of blood pressure issues, and my bp has gotten better! I can't take **, won't take ** bc of seizures. So what does that leave? **. But, like my doctor said, "change your pharmacy, YOU ARE MY LIABILITY, NOT WALMART'S!" So, I picked up my script of ** today, and will NEVER, EVER set foot in Walmart again. Btwn the new pharmacy, Hy-vee Costco, and AMAZON... I'LL BE JUST FINE. WALMART has way overstepped their bounds, and will never get another dime from me. It blows my mind they are so concerned for us, mostly baby boomers... yet. Are NOT about the child-labor sweatshops that they use in China to make their products. That is beyond PATHETIC.
*: Walmart is a rip off - I will not go back. I went to see an eye doctor today & he looked up online to see which place is cheaper. He showed me the computer screen & the cheapest was $17 at Walmart. When I went in to get it they said it was $42. This is the 2nd time they’ve done this - the first time it was a different medication that I got at Safeway for $13 and Walmart charged me $65.
*: I went to Walmart here in Fairbanks, AK and they always nicely fill my scripts. Well, I go back there for a refill and there was a new pharmacist working one I never dealt with before. The worker nicely runs my script and says, "Let me see if I got enough". Then the new pharmacist quickly runs over to see what my script is... without hesitation she rudely denies me right there on the spot???? With disgust in her face???? Unbelievable! Her reason was "I don't feel comfortable filling this." Ummm... it's not like I brought a ** script in, I brought my ** script that I been on for over 3yrs. 
*: Husband pain management doctor called in a prescription for narcotic... the same meds he has taken for years. They refused to fill it because my husband has a pain pump. The pills are for breakthrough pain which is better than a bolus machine. The pharmacist started rattling off the side effects to taking the medication. I interrupted him asking if he had a MD behind his name. What makes a pharmacist believe he has a right to overstep the doctor. Pulling all my meds out of Walmart and going back to my neighborhood pharmacy.
*: I've been taking pain pills for years now. (Which is the lowest dose.) Suddenly I'm told by Walmart that unless I switch Doctors and go to pain management that they would not fill my prescription. I had no choice as no other pharmacy would accept me in this small town but to switch doctors. Mind you I still have anxiety going to my normal Dr. Along with my narrowed spine, I have chronic migraines, anxiety (which the new Dr wont allow me to take meds for now and I ONLY took as needed not every day), PTSD from my mother being killed in front of me, gout and I could go on...
*: My wife went to WalMart to get our Meds since we use Humana and WalMart is the preferred pharmacy, we started to get our Meds there. I can tell you that the pharmacist was horrible. I went to pick up our medicine, since the system had called me to let me know that it was ready. The lady at the pick up side said that she did not have it ready. I said to her that I got a call and it said that it was ready, and asked to speak with the pharmacist. He came in and started to speak to me which I could not understand him, his accent was so thick. I am an immigrant and do know about thick accents since I had one, then, he asked me to go to CVS or to Walgreens. Well those pharmacies are NOT my preferred one. Please Wal-Mart take care of this mess.
*: My 5 yr old son had surgery this morning and got discharged at 10am. We dropped the prescription off at 10:15am. So then I get a phone call that it's the wrong strength and that she would call the dr as soon as she got off the phone with me. So then she calls me back and said that she had to leave a voicemail and that I should call to get it going faster. So I did it because my son just had surgery and they don't care. When I was a pharm tech I would elevate the call to the dr. But nope we didn't get that service. So I called at 6:30 pm because I thought I would of received a phone call that it was ready but NOPE! So they said it was ready. It's not how you run a pharmacy! I want something done!!!
*: I have been picking up my pain medicine from my local Walmart for years. Today I went in and they told me my script will be less than the normal amount. I inquired why and the man rudely stated, "Because people abuse these pills and you now have to manage your pain better". I told him I was in a severe accident and need my regular dosage that my body is used to. I asked if he could contact my dr to see if it was a mistake. He stated that even if it was a mistake and got corrected, he would contact my dr again and make him give me even less medicine. What gives this pharmacist the right to do that? He does not know my medical history. I was so embarrassed by this man today.
*: For the last 2 months the Wal-Mart Pharmacy in Kimball Tennessee don't have most of my prescriptions. I have to wait or go somewhere else. I have been using this pharmacy since it opened. I can see one but not three.
*: I am so mad at Walmart Pharmacy I could scream. I am a pain management patient. Have been for years. I use a discount card SingleCare to purchase my pain meds. Have for a couple of years. I am on Social Security Disability and don't have Medicare yet and no Medicaid. I can't afford insurance, so I rely on discount cards so I can afford my medications. Today I get a text my prescription is ready, instead of my usual $20.00 it's $105.00. I call them and they don't take discount cards for pain medications anymore. Because I might be a druggie. I have to have someone get my prescription and take it Walgreens where it's going to more than double my cost. I am disabled and can't get around to do this for myself right now. WALMART THERE ARE HONEST PEOPLE IN TREATMENT, WHO NEED THESE MEDS. I got my social security disability first try because of my pain. Corporate can go to hell.
*: I work in medicine for a major pharmaceutical company and have for over a decade. I understand the rules and why things have to be the way they are. That doesnt mean I agree with them. Walmart pharmacists are the worst. They are in general arrogant and obviously have esteem issues among other things. I unfortunately have been terribly ill and did not realize how absolutely invasive and offensive pharmacists can be. They had the nerve to lecture me about a medication that my doctor and I agreed to taking. 
*: I contacted my doctor's office asking for a few scripts to be faxed to Walmart Pharmacy on the 23rd, a week in advance, because the Walmart Pharmacy here keeps screwing stuff up. One week later, on the day the prescriptions were to officially be filled, the pharmacy told me they had not received any scripts from my doctor - even though I had verification from my doctor's office on the 23rd, 2 hours after I requested the scripts to be sent to Walmart.
*: I have used Walmart's online pharmacy for several years for my monthly supply of medical drugs for Type II diabetes. In the past I have done this by first logging into Walmart.com, then into the online pharmacy where I could check to see how many prescriptions I have remaining and to refill them whenever needed. At some point in 2017 Walmart's online pharmacy changed its online security methodology and from that point I have not been able to be verified or to login at the online pharmacy login site. Each time I was referred to my local Walmart pharmacy store at 1911 Marsha Sharp Fwy, Lubbock, Texas to be "verified" but three trips to my local pharmacy have yet to resolve the login problem.
*: Won’t fill pain meds from 2002 injury - I have been in pain management since my work accident in 2002. Only problems I have had filling this is from insurance, or lack thereof. On May 10, 2018 I had been to my monthly appointment. He faxes my prescription to Walmart. For several months now, every now and then they are out and I have to return when they get their shipment in.
*: I took an Uber from My Pain Management to refill my pain meds from an elevator crash 16 years ago breaking my legs and my back. Never had a problem. They were always easy and pleasant to me. When I gave the prescription to the woman at the drop off window she greeted me by name. Said it would be about 30 to 45 minutes. That's fine. I am not mobile. I was in an electric cart. Went and got a few grocery items. Went back. My prescription wasn't ready, another went by. The Pharmacist said the dosage was too high and he needed to confirm from the Dr.??? It was actually lower than last year and lower what my Dr wanted me to take. 
*: On several occasions I've tried to fill/refill prescriptions only to be told they are out of stock. What's worse is they say they don't know when inventory will be received. How can a business that absolutely affects the health of consumers not have inventory??? I was without a thyroid medication for nearly a week before. Now, I can't get a prescription for my daughter filled because of this nonsense and she's been without it for 3 days. I've had to call my daughter's pediatrician to see if they will send it to another pharmacy. Walmart tells me they don't know what they're receiving on a daily basis and I'm supposed to call every day to see if the drug is in. No thanks, I'll take my chances with a reputable company going forward.
*: Took a legitimate prescription to the new Neighborhood WalMart in Murrells Inlet SC located at Frontage Road. The pharmacist called me 5 minutes after I dropped it off angrily stating a schedule 2 med from out of state could not be filled in SC nor at any Walmart, it was the policy. I've been filling this for years without incident. When I arrived I was told the "city where the Rx was written is filled with clinics that write this stuff and hand it out like candy". I'm apparently lucky "she didn't keep my Rx and report me" (for what? trying to fill a prescription?). I asked if she called and verified the Rx but was told "she didn't need to because who knows what kind of relationship I have with this doctor" What the heck? 
*: So I have been taking opioid for several years due to major back problems. These last few months of filling my script at Walmart pharmacy had been a pain. They lecture me, make me wait forever and barely want to hand the medication over. I do not abuse the meds. I take them as prescribed by my doctor but they still treat me like I'm an addict. I have all the verification I need from the doctor, insurance company, etc to have this medication legally every month. I went to get it filled today and they told me 30 min it would be done. Check back in 30 and they say they will not fill because they no longer fill prescriptions from my doctor's office. I just don't get it since that has never been a problem before. I think they just make up excuses not to fill prescription pain meds for anybody these days.
*: I dropped 2 prescriptions to the Walmart Pharmacy on Philips Hwy-Jacksonville FL. One was new (a $4 antibiotic) and the other was a refill of an anti-fungal that I first got filled at the Walmart on Normandy Blvd. It took 2 days for the Philips Hwy Walmart Pharmacy to fill the antibiotic and 5 days to fill the anti-fungal. When I went to pick up the anti-fungal (14 pills, 100mg) I was told the cost was over $91. I disagreed, explaining that it was a $39 Rx refill that I'd already had filled once at the Walmart Pharmacy on Normandy 3 weeks ago and that 2 days prior the Philips Hwy pharmacist had already confirmed the $39 cost for the refill. The tech leaned over the register at me and said "Well, this ISN'T the Walmart Pharmacy on Normandy, this is the Walmart Pharmacy on PHILIPS." I was also told I could not use my Good Rx coupon. I told this Tech that the price isn't right and to cancel the RX, I would transfer it back to the other Walmart Pharmacy. 
*: I went to the Walmart at I-10 East Freeway @ Freeport St to have my prescription for my pain medicine filled, as I have every 2 weeks for the last 2 years, to be told I needed to have my Doctor fax over my treatment plan. I physically pick up the prescription from my doctor's office and carry it to this same pharmacy every 2 weeks. My doctor did not feel comfortable passing my medical information via fax, anyone would have access to it which is a violation of my rights under HIPAA. The pharmacist refuses to fill my prescription with no good reason. I have seen this doctor since I was 15 years old, I'm 46 now, I think that qualifies as a good doctor/patient relationship. 
*: This is my horrible experience with Walmart Pharmacy at 5302 North Garland Ave., Garland Texas 75044, on April/16/2018. This morning after my visit of my doctor, he faxed all my prescriptions to the above pharmacy. After two hours I went to Walmart, I was told that the medications shall be ready until one P.M, so I went back until 2.30 P.M, to make sure it is ready for me. This time I was told it is still not ready & was asked to wait another 10 minutes. Afterward, it is another wait for 10 more minutes, so on & so on. Eventually, I had to leave for my wife who is in the hospital. Walmart is the worse pharmacy I ever experienced. If you don't mind to stuck into a situation of an endless waiting for your prescriptions. Go Ahead & wish you luck!
*: To make a very long story short, following several months, well no, years of unprofessional service I finally decided to voice my concerns with corporate. I was assured that the situation would be dealt with. Unfortunately I believed this. Recently when I called to ask a question the person I spoke with wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise, we were going nowhere as we were now raising OUR voices, so I hung up. The individual actually called me back within minutes and told me to never come into that pharmacy again as I wasn't welcomed there and hung up!! Can you say Human Rights issue? This store in Niagara Falls NY has the most ignorant, non-professionals that one can EVER imagine. STAY AWAY, many other stores nearby with comparable prices.
*: After moving to Bonham Tx from Allen Tx at Kroger's and believing Walmart would work okay for my pharmacy needs I was unfortunately disappointed. I brought in all of my prescription bottles so they could see the drug, date last filled, mg size and prescribing doctor. Several times they had several trainees on during the same shift the service was slow and inadequate while looking for my only to be surprised when the pharmacist said they could not fill it since they were going to lunch. I had never had this poor of pharmacy service until I discovered what they did next. 
*: On March 7th, I went to the Walmart at 3829 US Hwy 77 in Corpus Christi Texas. I went to the pharmacy there to pick up two prescriptions called in by my doctor. The clerk that waited on me was rude and would not listen to me. I told her I had two prescriptions to pick up and I gave her my name and date of birth. After she checked, she came back and insisted that I had 3 prescriptions to pick up. I told her no that there was only two and she argued and said that the doctor must of added a generic and besides it was in with my other medicine. She was rude of course and told me I had to take all of them and that the extra prescription was on five dollars. So to cut down on the conflict from her, I paid for them and left. I took the meds when I got home for my nightly dosage and got sick and sat back and passed out. 
*: Walmart Pharmacy- Daphne, AL. My wife and I went to this pharmacy today to get my prescription of ** filled. The woman pharmacist refused to fill it. When we asked her why she said "that was her preferred judgment". Asked her to explain it. She refused. We then went to the assistant Manager, Julia. She said there was nothing she could do. Since I have been doctoring since 1992 (since I broke my back and have been exposed to Agent Orange) including but not limited to: orthopedic surgeon, neurosurgeon, family doctor and now a pain doctor and given different medications and am now on **. I am positive this pharmacist who is employed by Walmart has violated my civil rights by denying not to fill my prescription even though I am also 100% disabled vet. I have every intention of filing a lawsuit and hope more customers also file.
*: Wal-Mart is convenient and is probably the main reason I use them. They carry the medicines I use and the co-pay is cheap. Reorders are easy via phone or online. I travel a lot and getting refills in different states is easy. I have had no issues using War-Mart Rx.
*: Just left the doctor's office. Was prescribed 10mg of ** once a day. Picked up my medication. Went home. Ate supper. Popped a pill. As I looked at the bottle which stated 20 mg of ** cut in half take once a day. Well why would you do that to a person who reads a prescription bottle when they just left the doctor's office and she told you how to take this pill. This was an awful experience. I have anxiety which is why I'm taking **. I had an awful night and am having an awful day. Side effects are amazing. No one should have to go through this. Do not trust. Read and now do we trust what's in the bottle if it is the drug it's supposed to be. Very bad experience and you wonder why I didn't read it why should I. Left the doctor's office 10 minutes ago talking about this drug that I'm going to take.
*: I understand the epidemic of opioids but everyone should not be accused of abusing meds! I have been taking ** for more than three years and have had this issue numerous times! I am out of medication which I SHOULD NOT JUST STOP! Walmart never called my doctor! I sent them an email and yet I went to pick up my script and it was not filled! They also tried to blame the doctor! They now have a policy at this store in Norwich, NY that they REFUSE TO FILL MY SCRIPT UNTIL 30 days add ER last fill/refill! This is causing me so much stress and aggravation! I have been without my meds, even though my insurance would accept filling the script a couple days prior to 30 days! Why is Walmart policing my doctor-prescribed medication that’s I HAVE NO HISTORY OF ABUSING! They literally stated “they were the addiction police,”. What on earth is happening! If I lose a pill I am out of luck and considered an abuser! 
*: Why is it that when you pay for your script you have to go stand in another line so the pharmacist can bag it. What the hell is this. Stand in line to get script then pay then stand in another line while pharmacist takes it out of the bag then puts it back in the bag. What a waste of my time. First I was told it was a state law. LIE. Then it was Walmart policy. Who make this policy. I refuse to go to another line and raise holy hell till they give me my script.
*: Walmart Pharmacy Johnsburg, IL - I have been filling my prescription at Walmart for years, I take ** for anxiety. My doctor does NOT provide refills so I have to physically go into the office every month to get a prescription. Brought the script in the same day doc wrote it like I've done for years, the staff told me my insurance declined to fill it as it was 4 days early. 
*: 1 Day post op and I called to ask about a medication. They hang up on me. They are rude and lack compassion. Anybody can work in the medical field and learn from a textbook... But you need compassion while dealing with patients.
*: I have transferred two prescriptions to two other pharmacies. The most recent was for a refill of a drug I use when symptoms set in. I have insurance. The price for six of these pills at Walmart was $42.00 for six pills. I asked if there was a generic replacement. Their answer was NO. I left the store, went home and researched the pill I am taking and guess what? There is a generic for it. The next surprise came when I went online and found a discount card thru Walgreens for $82.50 for 30 pills making it $2.75 per pill versus $6.08 per pill. I had my prescription transferred to Walgreens. Went back to Walmart and showed them my receipt from Walgreens and they countered with 36.50 for 6 pills.
*: I have logged in innumerable times to this site. All I wanted this time was a printout of my 2017 subscription purchases. But suddenly, I get "Walmart has instituted a new level of security to protect your identity." Okay, no problem right? I answer ALL the questions accurately -- date of birth, phone number, pin, etc. "We're sorry. You cannot access your account at this time. Please bring your ID to your local pharmacy and we will we glad to initiate access to your account." WHAT???
*: The pharmacy assistant at the register, Arvealetta, was rude and dismissive. She has been unprofessional on several occasions and continues to be so. For that reason, I have decided to remove my business from your pharmacy and will encourage my family and friends to do so if/when they encounter this woman's rudeness.
*: The pharmacy had one of my prescriptions ready to go but it had to be held for a few days due to refill guidelines. The pharmacy admitted they took the script off the shelf and used to for another patient. When I went to pick up my medicine I was told they were out. This was Wednesday the 7th, after I told the pharmacy that was unacceptable they gave me 7 pills, and stated the rest would be in on Thursday. I called Thursday and they said it would be Friday. It is Friday now I am running out of my medicine and the pharmacy tech said it could be as late as Monday. The pharmacy didn’t even call me, I had to call them! I would like to know the legality and duty the pharmacy has to fulfill orders.
*: My doctor electronically sent in a prescription. 1/30/18. I have enough until 2/7/18. These are 30 day scripts and I usually get it filled on that day. Here it is day 29 and they’ve had 10 days to order and they said it still didn’t come in. Very dangerous and unprofessional.
*: Bought generic ** at Walmart with Humana insurance. It cost 97.50. Could have gotten it at Kroger with just a good RX coupon for 51.00. Kroger is better every time. Finally I have figured it out. Walmart will rip you off.
*: I'm the sole caregiver for my grandparents and they use Walmart Pharmacy. For the past two years I have been taking care of them and also have the very unfortunate task of going to and dealing with Walmart. My grandfather only has a few prescriptions that only need refilled every once in a while, however my grandmother is a diabetic, along with having numerous other necessary medications. I am in the pharmacy at least once a week, if not, three or four times. I know that all but two of the employees in there are all completely clueless, including the pharmacist. Funny enough, the one employee who is the most ignorant and rude is the only one that doesn't have their certifications on the wall. Kind of makes me wonder.
*: At the beginning of the new year I brought in my new Part D insurance cards to start using Walmart Pharmacy for the new year for 2018. At the time I did not have an Rx to fill but the gal at the pharmacy took the cards to put on file. Soon after my doctor called in an Rx and the pharmacy used my old Rx card to fill the Rx. I found this out before I went to pick up my meds and got it fixed with the pharmacy over the phone. When I went to pick up my meds they still had not used my new cards AND they implied that I gave them the wrong cards. They were beyond condescending... The pharmacist laughed at me and asked if I needed to have someone explain how this worked.
*: Took 4 days resolve after went back. Staff actually called tech, he didn't notify because didn't hear back and since tried prior locked out, if locked out staff only one get unlocked. This guy very helpful. Once unlocked tonight finally works now, didn't even need do security. Saw must had issue my account they had fix since tech got whole info including email. Also so go staff tell them call tech. First day there half hour but eventually worked. I have too many addresses and probably can't delete. Might been another issue. Wish could delete all those though.
*: Walmart Pharmacy App is pretty well broke. I send in a refill... They say it is not received! I can't access My Pharmacy to see the scripts available to me...because of fraud concerns! I requested access but they blocked me! Their response: "We received your request to access your Walmart Pharmacy account but unfortunately some of the information did not match what we have on file. To protect your healthcare information, we have a strict online validation process that guards against fraud. We know this can be an inconvenience for some customers, especially when information does not match and we are unable to immediately grant access. 
*: The Walmart pharmacy in Yuba City California, think that everybody that uses an high dosage of ** is a drug addict. They accused me of being a drug addict and I am misusing my medication. I am a leukemia survivor in remission with side effects. I have arthritis in my ankles, neck, back, wrist, and hands. The head pharmacist have no right to tell my new pharmacy that I transfer to, that I am a drug addict.
*: They have no Quality Assurance (QA) in processing their online orders. Most of the time their system is broken. If you order a refill that requires a new prescription from the doctor, the transaction is removed from an online status and moved to a manual status. Once there, even after the new prescription is received, they do not process it automatically. Instead, if you signed up for telephone notifications they are suppose to call you and verify that you actually want the drug. Of course if you did not sign up for notifications, the transaction is put on hold. So, after you run out and call them, then they try to process it, but the manual data they have does not match what is in the online system, so all their data (credit card info) is outdated and the transaction fails. Again if you're not signed up for notifications the transaction is put on hold again.
*: As I Cyber Security threat researcher and a Customer of Wal-Mart I was very disturbed that one of your Pharmacy Technicians chose to post a screenshot of her work computer on Facebook. The Facebook post clearly shows the Name, Address, Phone Number, DEA Prescription #, and the DEA authorization # of four patients. Posting confidential Personal Identifying Information (PII) is a clear violation of Federal Law as stated by HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996). The Pharmacy Technician's name is: Rebecca ** and appears to work in the Federal Way, Washington State area. Her post can be seen: ** Under “Saw a little piece of home today”. 
*: Went online like I always have to view my pharmacy orders. Walmart has instituted a new log in that requires a security code. After signing up and logging in, it tells you that you must sign in as a guest and pick up your medications at your local pharmacy. THIS IS AN ONLINE PHARMACY. There is no local Walmart for me to pick up prescriptions and I didn't want to order anything - just view my account. The customer service department I called says they are aware of the issue but they can't give me any information about my account due to privacy issues. It could also take up to 2 days for them to contact me. So, let me get this straight. I can't access my medications online and Walmart can't either. And I have to wait until they get around to me in order to figure it out! This will undoubtedly turn into a major legal issue for Walmart down the line. I hope they get their crap together because this is completely unacceptable.
*: This is the second time Wal-Mart Pharmacy has withheld my medication unless I give them medical information. It isn't even the pharmacist who is asking the information. It is an employee in a smock. I just saw my primary care physician and they called in the medication for me. It is a topical cream. I have been on it for 3 years and suddenly they are refusing to refill my prescription unless I answer medical questions.
*: Today was the 2nd time Walmart has been OUT of my medications (**)... And they tried to give me a $50 ** instead of the $10 (3 month) one when they finally came in. I refused so they took it back and gave me the $10 one. When I asked what the difference was, they said they changed manufacturers for the $4 and $10 pills. They're still out of **, it's been about 2 weeks. I asked why, they said they're very busy and having trouble keeping up.
*: I am a 60 year old disabled man who has been getting my pain medication at Walmart for almost 2 years and they decided they would no longer fill it without any concern for my pain, basically saying, "Tough luck," with no empathy. I really believe they could care less about your health are wellness. It's all about profits.
*: For the last two months my Dr has got me in a few days early so when I left they put my medicine on file. I was told that they would be filled on a certain day so I go expecting to pick up when I get there. They then tell me they're out of stock!!! Now by this time I'm completely out of my meds and now they're saying they have to order... This doesn't make sense to me. Hey Wal-Mart wake up, get off your butts and do your jobs!!!
*: Beware. You get what you pay for. Went there to save money on my prescriptions. I don't understand how can they not have your order ready after you get a email. Then they have no record of me placing my order online. Had to go back to the window to re-order them again and after waiting for a very long time I go up to see if they are ready and no one was even working on them or received my order yet again they asked me DID you order them. I just told them forget it I will go somewhere else. They really need to get their crap together. And we trust these people with our lives. Let's hope that they never have a huge mistake that will cost someone their life!!!
*: I have always dreaded filling my prescription at Walmart because every tech behind the counter thinks that they are better than you, especially if you're filling something like **. I am so sick and tired of being judged for having this vice. They lied to me on this occasion saying they sent my prior authorization to my doctor. This was Thursday... So Friday it's obvious nothings gonna get done and I fill a 3 day script for 60 dollars. Monday comes along and I call my doctor around noon and they say they still haven't received the authorization. I call the pharmacy and they say it usually takes a week. They ask where the doctor is out of again and the fax so clearly they never sent it. Once again your neighborhood Walmart discriminating its paying customers. Now I'm sick from withdrawals and it's on you Walmart so ** you.
*: Shorted my prescription 11 pills and my prescription wasn't to be ready till 4 days later. They made me come back with what pills I had left to only give me 3 pills of the 11 shorted. Then when I went back to get the refill and only got 4 pills because they didn't have any in stock!! This pharmacy is a joke, my prescription is life or death and they want to play around. This isn't a controlled medication. They have repeatedly shorted medication.
*: I filled my pain prescriptions here occasionally because I picked up groceries. But the service and communication was very poor. The pharmacy website is horrible. My Rx I dropped off yesterday was delayed and I was told to called them next day after waiting for 30 mins. They don't even offer to contact me at all. After more than 14 hours, I hear nothing from them! Lazy employees and careless system. They don't seems to be happy with their jobs like most of them working here. One more thing, I have just found out the cost for my pain pills was 60% more than at W. I am going back to the real pharmacy with professional system and attitude.
*: I went to Wal-Mart for my shingle shot and sat there for 1.5 hrs. When they pulled the gate for lunch. One of the assistants came out and said, “Oh you with the shot it’s not authorized” and walked away. I'M on SS disability and have Humana insurance so when I called them I was told by Humana it had been authorized 1.5 hrs ago. I called the store manager and he was told the assistant though I couldn't afford it. The manager then gave me a $20 dollar gift card and apologized. My spine is so bad it takes me15 minutes once I'm in the store to get to the pharmacy. Shame on Wal-Mart.
*: I have been going to the Walmart Pharmacy for five years now. This last year has been horrible. I am using a new drug and they never had it stocked. I would order it with other prescriptions go pick them up, come home minus that new drug and no one told me. Very inconvenient. I live out of town and not close to the Walmart. Another thing happened that we are just now figuring out. I thought this was my fault for the last few weeks. It is not, at all. About a month ago my doctor called and added to a prescription. Well Walmart dropped what I needed and used the new one the doc called in. No one let me know. I kept using the old prescription use of 2 tablets and ran out a few weeks early. This affected my sleep. For 2 weeks there it was messed up without the drug. Weeks later it is now getting straightened out. I switched to another pharmacy. Enough is enough.
*: I tried using the Walmart app to refill my prescriptions but it does not work. When placing my order it sends a text telling me the order will not be ready for another two weeks. When I contact the pharmacy to ask why it takes so long to process my order. They say it will be ready the next day. Sometimes when I place my order through the app the pharmacy does not receive it at all. Needless to say I will not be using the app at all to refill prescriptions. It does give a list of all my prescriptions in case I need to refer back to them though.
*: My doctor called in my pain medication last week Tuesday for my acute chronic pancreatitis to the boiling springs SC Walmart. They didn't want to fill the script last Tuesday because they were either prejudice or ridiculous because the pharmacist said the medication was too expensive to process the script. If you thought the medicine was too expensive, can't your brain process the thought of following up with the doctor that wrote the script. That's the excuse I got when I called Thursday morning to find out where my medicine was. Then when I complained Thursday, they claimed they ordered it Thursday and it would arrive Tuesday. Then when I called this morning Tuesday and demanded to speak with the store manager because pharmacy kept hanging up, or letting the phone just ring, he went over to talk to them. 
*: I've been getting my ** and ** for years here. Here's my problem, I've had refills on my ** that they said were too early, and then they don't have them, and then I'll be a refill Short. I honestly believe that they've screwed up more times than I can count! Also, now, they tell me I cannot fill my ** during the same amount as the **, even though, I only use the ** for extreme pain during menstruation and I have Crohn's disease and it helps me, but they're saying they can't do it. I've had it with them! I've never had such poor service and made to feel like a Junkie, even though I've NEVER filled it early ever! I'm sick of them. It was embarrassing and disgusting. I don't understand why if my DR of over 18 years knows me, why Walmart can decide which is right for me.
*: I have been using WM's pharmacy for many, many years and have found the pharmacists very helpful and patient. I have no complaints about them at all. The other employees of the pharmacy can be hit or miss and are often sloppy, causing us to drive to the pharmacy to pick up an item only to find out it's not ready after all but I usually avoid this by asking to speak to the pharmacist about my orders - which they themselves have recommended. I often order my refills online but lately - since September 2017 - I have not been able to log into my pharmacy account. I have worked with online customer service and was even sent to an "escalated" type of help but they ended up telling me I had to "verify" my account in the pharmacy and things would start working. The problem is the pharmacists have not heard a word about this. Just wondering if anyone else is suddenly having problems accessing their pharmacy account.
*: I received a call from Walmart re: ** 40 mg recall. I had a full bottle that was filled 9/5/17. Thankfully I had not yet started taking. I called Walmart and it was explained to me that they found out 9/26/17 about the recall and then called me. I went onto website and found article dated 8/15/17 explaining about the recall of this drug. I believe Walmart dropped their responsibility on this one. I will either have to go elsewhere for my medicine or do their job and check monthly on my prescriptions for **.
*: I am a 'frequent flyer' at the Walmart pharmacy. All too often they seem baffled as to filling orders for RX sent by my doctor. The most recent event (9-14-17) was their incorrect assertion that my insurance company would not fill my prescription for three more weeks! As a direct result of their incompetence I went three days without my medication resulting in the beginnings of withdrawal symptoms and sleepless nights. This morning bright and early I paid a visit to my doctor who had already been in contact with the Walmart pharmacy in Middle Island and corrected their egregious error.
*: My daughter has real bad seizures when she dont get her meds for four time this year. I had to fight with the pharmacy to get her meds on time. And they claim not to get a fax from her doctor office when they did in fact get it... They just like toying with peoples lives. I would trade pharmacy if I could but it the closest one that has her type of pills. But they need to get with the program soon or I'll raise hell.
*: I have had no problems with Walmart Pharmacy. What's nice that if you are out of town or whatever you can go to any Walmart and they can pull all the info up on computer and you can refill your meds.
*: Second time my Dr. ordered this and the second time they did not have it. They never notified me and I needed this medicine for a very serious life threatening condition. They are not doctors and should not have left it up to me to call them. Irresponsible behavior. Shame on them. No way to complain on their website either.
*: This is the worst pharmacy ever!!! Every time I come to the drive thru I sit and wait at least 30 minutes after they told me it would be ready in 10 minutes. Then when I told her I would wait she rolled her eyes and hung up the receiver.
*: They provide good service but the computer software needs tweaking, & some pharmacists do not look through the prescriptions to see what is expired & still valid. Also updating customer info is not happening as smooth as possible.
*: Last week I went to my Dr for my check up... Needed refills Rx. Dr called them in. Went later that evening to pick them up. Girl at the counter told me my Rx wasn't covered and I needed to call back the Dr. So I did. He recalled. I went back there the next day. They told me they were out. Couldn't get them in. I have been taking that same Rx for 10 years. BP MEDS. First they tell me I'm not covered then they tell me they don't have any. Couldn't they tell the Dr that. So he could change it. What am I supposed to do? Die? This has been going on for a while now. Are they playing God? Choosing who lives and dies.
*: This is a convoluted mess. NOT worth the time and trouble. After a week of dealing with this I'm headed anywhere but Walmart Pharmacy (online or brick-n-mortar). Started with a simple understanding that all you had to do was get your doctor to fax your prescriptions to the 1-800 # and voila you could get a 90 day supply of any prescription on the generic prescription list for only $10.00! "Great", he says. "Call my Dr. and have them transferred" he says... we received a 30 count bottle of one med and 9 - 30 count bottles of another and a $40.00 bill... $40. For the same prescriptions we could have picked up from our Walmart store for $16.00 WTHeck?!
*: I've gotten my prescriptions through Wal-Mart for years, and while some are better than others, overall they are consistent and reliable. I've been in several cities and states in the last few years, and it's always easy to transfer or pick up wherever I end up.
*: I use Walmart because of the drug program from Humana. This program allows me to get my meds for a very good price - $1.00 per month. But I do not like the service I get at Walmart or the attitude of the workers.
*: Shingles Vaccine - I am 50 years old and my dr sent a script to Walmart pharmacy in Centre, AL. They informed me that I was not allowed to have it because I was not 60. It has been approved for 50 and up but ins won't pay unless you are 60. (I had no problem paying for it out of pocket.) They refused to give it to me. My dr then sent it to CVS in Centre, AL and I received the vaccine. Is Walmart really that far behind or do they just not want to do their jobs??? We always have trouble with them and most of them are not very friendly at all!!
*: Tried to re-order a prescription online. I needed the item mailed to me because I cannot drive to pick it up. After a 'chat' with an idiot, speaking to a live idiot, transferred to Pharmacy who never answered, calling back a number concerning prescriptions being mailed, I was told, "You don't have an account to mail your prescriptions". And you know this how? Why didn't your ignorant website tell me this? And advise how to resolve the situation? End result: transferring my prescriptions to another vendor and praying really hard that Amazon buys out this monstrously stupid company. It's not just Wal-Mart, it's Sam's as well. I have never spoken to so many illiterate people in my life.
*: I have chronic insomnia and I am 65 yrs young. I do everything I can to make this problem manageable. Walmart Pharmacy has put holds on my medications more than once. The only thing that actually worked was **. I had to call my insurance provider for 3 months to get it back. When I did finally, the capsules are out of date or placebo. I am so tired of not sleeping and it's all due to the pharmacy in Tomah Wi. They give me the runaround and said my insurance put a hold on it and when my Dr.'s nurse called me she let it slip that it was the pharmacy. It would be different if I was a drug abuser but I am NOT. I JUST WANT TO SLEEP. Not getting proper rest is very detrimental. I feel very confused and depressed due to lack of sleep.
*: Walmart Pharmacy Holly Springs, NC gave me a blood pressure medication instead of a muscle relaxer! When I picked up my meds I called back to the pharmacy alerting them that my meds look different, they said; "We changed manufacturers", so I took the medication as prescribed twice per day as needed. I was weak, fainted, wrecked my car, developed SVT heart problem then Sinus tachycardia! Wore a heart monitor for a month! Have to take a beta blocker twice a day for the rest of my life! Walmart offered me 4K for my troubles! I have a life of pills thanks to Walmart Pharmacy's neglect! I want the world to know what happened to me so it doesn't happen to anyone else! I'm having to go to my cardiologist every six months for the rest of my life because Walmart Pharmacy almost caused my death! 
*: I picked up my third 90 Day Prescription since switching to Walmart last December. I ordered these refills last week knowing one would need physician approval and they still had a work day to contact him. I checked status Monday and the one had not been approved and I re-ordered. I was thinking I could pick them up when I went to town in a couple of days. I checked order status Monday and one was not refilled because they still needed to contact physician and I re-ordered again knowing it may be an issue with the 4th of July. 
*: I've been using this pharmacy for about 2 years now and I have to say I'm more than pleased. I'm actually closer to another branch but I choose to go where people treat me right. I've been to other pharmacies where I'm treated like a junkie or a criminal meanwhile I'm a single dad who's just trying to do the best he can. The staff all know me. We can even joke around and they always help me if I have a question. They've even gone out of their way to find coupons for me because I don't have insurance. Now they don't have to do any of that it's not at all in their job description but they still do. I would recommend this branch to anyone needing to switch. Bravo to the entire staff.
*: I have my prescriptions filled by Wal-Mart in Taylor PA. I'm concerned about Pharmacists that work there. Pretty much on an every other month the pharmacists there DON'T read my notes and I end up driving back to get the order right. I am worried that they are going to mess up with an order because they do not read. They filled the order wrong again and I called Walmart and the person said I'm sorry. I said, "Can you please send someone here to pick up the mistake?" "No we don't have anyone for that." I was talking to someone else about this and they said this happens to a few people he knew. SO I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS A PROBLEM WITH THEM. Then if you call 1800 Wal-Mart they tell you they're busy call back later. They CARE.
*: Pharmacy - Store 3236 - I am reporting a pharmacy employee Zan and Pharmacy manager Jemma **. I gave my prescription to Zan who Very Rudely asked if I had insurance! Told her yes, and that all my information was in the computer. Zan started screaming that there is NO INSURANCE INFO in the system AND if I have a CHARITY VOUCHER! While SCREAMING! Jemma ** did absolutely nothing to de-escalate the situation. Keep in mind I have been filling prescriptions at Walmart for over 10 yrs. with the same insurance company.
*: I was near the pharmacy at the East Rome, GA Walmart, when a man walks up beside me and just walks off with my shopping cart. I wasn't even sure how to respond at first, but managed a meek "umm...hey... that's my cart..." Of course, I was ignored. I stated a little louder "Excuse me?" Again, nothing. He just kept on walking. Well, I'm not going to stand there and allow myself to be a victim, so I said loudly "Excuse me! That's my cart!" He finally stopped, and returned it. This wasn't a big deal, maybe it was just an accident... but either way, *he* was the one in the wrong, NOT me. 
*: Pathetic service. I have been informed by the girl to pick up my prescription after 25 minutes. And even after an hour they don't even know who I am. And olderly lady is trying to search my prescription which she couldn't get hold off.
*: My wife, who has been taking the same thyroid medication for years went to Walmart in Morgantown, PA to get her prescription. She was given the wrong pills. These generic pills have the same active ingredients as the pills she has been taking for the last 20 years, but the inactive ingredient are much higher in salt content which raises her blood pressure. The pharmacists was very rude insisting that the pills were the same. Having worked for the FDA and having checked with two other pharmacists, the FDA, and the Drug Manufacturer, I found out that I was right. And since we had gotten her prescription at this Walmart for about a year, I wanted to know why he couldn't fill it. He told us it was company policy and told me to call 1 800 Walmart to get the company's policy. 
*: Walmart store #2482, Mesa Riverview Dobson Rd., Mesa AZ. I am reporting a pharmacy employee named **, and the pharmacist who was on duty and in charge at the time, **. First let me say that I have reported ** before to the store managers at least twice, and nothing gets done about him. He is consistently rude to me and my husband when we come in, and has a very cocky attitude.
*: I am on several medications, and have been on some of them for many years. I had to get an exception for one, so I could get my full order of 90 tablets for a 30 day supply. This is one that if I miss a dose, I go through withdrawals. Well, when I got my refill the pharmacist called me, she said she didn't have the full amount. I needed some to get me through until their order came in, she said she can do that. I just called to tell them I would be there tomorrow to pick up the rest, only to be told I have to get a new prescription. She said, "When you accepted a lesser amount you're accepting as if that is what the doctor wrote for." Well, I was never told that, I would never have accepted that.
*: Called in prescription, went to pick it up. They said somehow the phone did not pick it up. I asked if I could come back later that evening to get it and she said fine. When I can be back they only had 8 pills. I usually get 3 months at a time because I take care of a bedridden patient. So... A few days later I have to go back to get the rest of that prescription only to find out they have changed hours without telling me (or anyone). I guess they do not think prescriptions for people are all that important?? So I am going back for my 4th time tomorrow to get one prescription. They could care less about people. They have the worse pharmacy hours of anyone already and they have some nerve to cut another hour off their already horrible hours. I am saying bye to this irritating group of people who could care less about their customers... They are just too big and powerful to give a rip!
*: Discharged from hospital, counselor cited hospital pharm price of $12 for generic, but suggested Wal-Mart as low-cost supplier with $4 program and sole source for affordable diabetic supplies. Discharged four hours after estimated time, little window for wife to collect generics and test supplies. Pharmacist told her about seven day return policy. Filled generic ** and ** (each $12 at hospital) for $90 each. Pharmacist refused return of unopened bag next morning. Explained price even higher than on-line since no coupon was presented. Oh, yes. The glucose meter had a dead betters and reports 50% errors in testing. Replacement FreeStyle Lite more sensitive with 95 percent read.
*: Very Rude Pharmacy Manager Derek. Wal-Mart Pharmacy did not have one of my prescriptions ready although they'd had plenty of time to fill. So I drove forty minutes back home then came back, stood in line 15 minutes and was told it still wasn't ready, told to come back in 20 minutes, returned again and told it still wasn't ready. Finally after sometime I was paged by the pharmacy manager, as I was walking up to rx desk I said, "It's a miracle!" The rx manager took offense to this and said "Do you want to take your business elsewhere?" I said, "I'll think about that." The rx manager said "Are you going to stop being condescending and treat us respectfully?" I then said, "Condescending? Respectfully?" He then tried his best at being sarcastic ie, explaining their meaning.
