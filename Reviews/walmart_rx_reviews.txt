[<p><p>Walmart Market Pharmacy in Northport, AL: IDK the name of the Asian pharmacist, but that's the only way I know to be specific about who. Every time I take scripts there, it's fine. But let me take a narcotic script there &amp; you can see how she changes. She will talk loud about how this is a narcotic, IDK if we can fill or we don't have any of that, or narcotics make people drowsy. </p></p>, <p>Walmart Market Pharmacy in Northport, AL: IDK the name of the Asian pharmacist, but that's the only way I know to be specific about who.

Another pharmacist told me they don't order many at a time, &amp; she won't order but so many &amp; often denies people their medicine. Who does she think she is? She obviously has no clue of how certain medications are for daily management &amp; should not be abruptly stopped like that. But she doesn't care. You can see the judgement in her face, &amp; I'm not the first person to notice this. It took many years to get my medicine adjusted &amp; she set me back again. The only reason I started trying to use this WM was location, but I will be going back to CVS I been using for 15 plus years.</p>]
[<p><p>I unfortunately have CVS Caremark. Considering their auto-deny policy and overpriced prescriptions, I use Wal-Mart and ask for best cash price.

[<p><p>I have a hard time comprehending how bad the experience can be in 2023. On hold for more than 40 minutes to refill a prescription because I need to change the credit card I have on file. Not sure if I will ever connect with anyone or if it will go on forever. It cannot tell me how long the wait is estimated to be. There is an option to get a call-back. I tried it, but it put me on hold for the callback system! After a long time waiting I hung up and re-called for the original wait. What's the point of waiting to schedule a call-back, the point is not to wait! I tried logging in online to do the same things but there is no option to change payment credit card. I cannot even refill the prescription online, it says to call the phone number. There is an option while on hold to leave a voicemail by pressing 1, but it doesn't work either.

[<p><p>Went to Walmart with a prescription for my husband after just leaving the hospital, was told they couldn't read it so they couldn't fill it. We're in Florida so we then took the same prescription to Publix supermarket where they promptly and very kindly had no issue reading the prescription and filling it. Spoke with the doctor's office and was told it's at the discretion of the pharmacist if they have an issue with a prescription for any reason. Absolutely ridiculous and just shows how little Walmart pharmacist care. You could clearly see my husband was standing there with the neck brace, bands on his arm from the hospital as well as covering from two IVs. If a pharmacist at that point cares that little then I will never be back! I am moving all of his prescriptions away from Walmart.</p></p>, <p>Went to Walmart with a prescription for my husband after just leaving the hospital, was told they couldn't read it so they couldn't fill it.

John, the store manager is disingenuous when engaging on serious issue with the pharmacy concerning anti-epileptic medication or holding employees accountable.

Every month you have to call in and speak to a rep who transfers you to a pharmacist who second guesses the doctor’s prescription.

The ONLY reason I use Walmart pharmacy is because Walgreens no longer accepts my insurance. The prescriptions are NEVER ready when they say that they will be. Very disappointed!

It has No snap to it. ** and any pill when fresh or kept right should snap and be fresh. I would get my script and it would crumble when I went to snap it in half. I mean crumble into pieces! No snap. Also when I took it and take it now it has lost potency. I'm literally laying on the couch like I took nothing. Very annoying. The sad thing is I'm stuck with these old pills all month!

[<p><p>Hello all, I am posting a different kind of review about my pharmacy here....

I use Walmart Pharmacy for my prescriptions, and have asked them repeatedly to stop having an automated robo call sent to me every time I request a refill, but they will not do so. Despite the fact that every single time I contact the pharmacy, and ask to be removed from this feature.</p>, <p>These robo calls are relentless, and last forever, never providing a means to stop them. At least not before I have to finaly give up on waiting for the option. It is an overly detailed recording that is providing numerous numbers to call, for this that or another, and explaining the process of contacting me for what seems like an eternity. To the point where I can no longer sit through it anymore, and hang up.</p>, <p>The reason I am complaining about the pharmacy for this, is because I have contacted them directly several times to stop this, and they always say it will stop, but it does not stop. I do not appreciate being lied to by my pharmacist, and this is what is happening. Personally, I think the person who answers the phone has call center mentality, and is just trying to get off the phone without having to do anything. I realize that dealing with angry customers on the phone is trying, but if you do not want to do your job then QUIT, and let someone else who needs employment take the job. Jobs nowadays are too hard to come by, for lazy people to be filling positions they cannot handle, while hardworking people are out there struggling!!</p>]
[<p><p>I go out of my way to go to this Wal-Mart but the action of the pharmacy today has left me outdone!

I have asthma, COPD, and sarcoidosis through no fault of my own and am firmly in the group most likely to die and these people capriciously risked my and others' lives to leave an hour early for something they didn't know about 12 minutes earlier when they sent the text telling us to come get our medications?</p>]

[<p><p>Through with Walmart Pharmacy. Lately my medications are on backorder more and more frequently. Even common medications such as blood pressure medicine. Now I have developed shingles in my right eye. Eye Dr called in a prescription eye gel. Now, this is serious, I could suffer permanent damage to my eye if not treated soon enough. It's now been 5 days since my prescription order was placed. They say it is on backorder. I was lucky enough that the Dr. had a couple of samples, but she gave me the last two and I only have enough for today's dosage. I don't believe this "backorder" excuse. It's walmart, they are not willing to employ enough people to get the job done. That being said I intend to call them today and tell them to just transfer that $474 medication to CVS.</p></p>, <p>Through with Walmart Pharmacy.

They are going to fill the prescription when they feel like it. While I am suffering with a migraine. Why is there so many spiteful people out there. This is day 5. From now on I'm going to make a copy of the prescription, so I'll know in advance if the diagnosis code is there. Maybe I should take my business somewhere else.

So when I told them my diagnosis and it was different from the last diagnosis, I was only given seven days again!</p>, <p>My daughter picked up the prescription for me. Nobody called to tell me 'bout the partial refill and they didn’t tell my daughter! I found out when I checked my meds. Although I was supposed to receive a call informing me, I didn’t, because that part of their policy isn’t important! And since it was already filled, I was accused of giving false information to the pharmacist! Because they can’t make mistakes! Ever! I’m not capable of knowing whether or not I have chronic back pain or shoulder pain! They refused to call my doctor to verify the information also! All this is five hours after the 45 minutes I was told that my prescriptions would be ready! Walmart Pharmacy sucks! WE’RE NOT ALL DRUG ADDICTS!</p>]

[<p><p>I am so unhappy about the service and attitudes of the staff and pharmacists at this store. Last month I took a prescription in for a cough medicine that they said was a narcotic and the pharmacist "chose" to not fill it. She said that the other pharmacists would, but she personally chose to not fill narcotics for this doctor (from a reputable, local doctor). Who is she to decide who to fill prescriptions for? I took in a prescription yesterday for something I have been on for 10 year, but the dosage had changed. It was a printed prescription on the doctor's form. They acted like I was a criminal and wouldn't fill it without verifying with the doctor that it was legitimate.</p></p>, <p>I am so unhappy about the service and attitudes of the staff and pharmacists at this store.

They could have easily called me back and told me that. Because of the pain I had to leave and we have to go back tomorrow. They said they had called, but when I talked to the nurse from the doctor's office she had not had a call from them. They are not God!!!! The techs are hateful and all treat you like you are scum if you get anything to do with mental health or pain filled.</p>]
[<p><p>My insurance last year eliminated the over 20 year satisfied use of my previous pharmacy leaving me with limited options. Walmart Pharmacy in Brockport NY is what I was left with in my town and it has been an insufferable nightmare since with a few exceptions that allowed me to give it an additional star. It is so bad. Just thinking of going there gives me such extreme anxiety and they rarely fail to deliver on the causes of that. Last night put me over the edge. There have been all too many incidents of their slothingly ways of dealing with lines which indicates how little value they have for consumer's time. They get chatty with the customers with long lines making the wait exponentially long over extraneous non essential drivel they placate other customers with. This is fine if there are not others waiting. If there is a line the staff need to move the customers they are with along. Alert them that they need to take the next customer. </p></p>, <p>My insurance last year eliminated the over 20 year satisfied use of my previous pharmacy leaving me with limited options.

This is fine if there are not others waiting. If there is a line the staff need to move the customers they are with along. Alert them that they need to take the next customer. </p>, <p>I literally ran into the store last night, my last day of being able to pick the items up, as they are constantly returning my items (because as I said their habits of creating such a long waiting experience are cause for such high anxiety I don't want to face it and my time is more valued to me than it is to them unlike previous pharmacy I sadly cannot use). I got there to 2 customers, one that was almost done and one in front of me. Tell me why I was in that line for 20 minutes? 20 MINUTES!!!! The customer then wanted to check out his groceries. This is a case of if there are others in line, it's a solid, "Not today. We have a line." Particularly if only one of the 5 people in the back is out there checking out customers. Maybe if two were doing that it would be okay. </p>, <p>Next a woman is called up who has an issue with her insurance, Walmart's computer is saying she picked up a script that she had 3 left of. She said she didn't, they said she could not get another until January and it became a long drawn out thing. No one said, "Hold on let me check out this other customer and get back to you," nope they can just stand there even though they look like they are about to freak right out from being held up so long. Not, "Hey, can one of you guys back there come check out customers," NOTHING!!!! Nope just lady in line, yet again, you don't matter, your time don't matter, we have groceries to check out with this chatty guy (I have been behind that dude before and he has held me up before and they just let him). And I get to be privy to the drama when I needed desperately to be somewhere and this stop as per usual screwed that up. </p>, <p>The worst part is AFTER I waited 20 minutes for TWO PEOPLE on a serious time budget, I get called up and as soon as I step up to the counter suddenly that is when one of the people in the back come up to check out the person after me. WHY did they not do that when chat man with his groceries was there? WHY did they not do that when insurance drama lady was there? The person behind me had just arrived but they got the red carpet instant second check out person availed to them? </p>, <p>Even more insult to injury, which fully disgusted me, the check out lady that made me wait for her to play games with these other folks and my time, says to me, "I am going as fast as I can!." And "Do you want to come back another time to pick these up?" I almost lost it. Making me wait 20 minutes is not as fast as you can when there were other people who could have come up to help me while you were with those other two, but let me just stand there having a panic attack for 20 minutes straight. And I had to strategically plan that window of time for pick up that made me have to call and ask them to hold my scripts that had been there almost 2 weeks so they did not put them back again, I was on the last day and she asks me after I waited 20 minutes to come back???? NO you get the person from the back to come up and move the line along and when there is drama you don't make others wait for that!!!! </p>, <p>I had family in from out of town that I never see and had a limited time to be with them and this cut into that few hours I had and I am devastated. But this is not a one time incident with them. I had to wait 20 minutes for a freaking consult once, just standing there forever, no one bothering to locate the pharmacist. People coming to pick up scripts are sick or injured or in pain quite often and they have far too often just ignored that to do non essential things and not find what would be simple ways to remedy their wait times. </p>, <p>I have had a few incidents where a few staff people have gone above and beyond but when I see a certain few like the blonde woman yesterday I know there is going to be a problem and there always is. She is a catalyst for inconsideration and I need their department to address this promptly and take a look at their inefficiency and lack of concern for their patients. I am incredulous at how they can perpetually and consistently do this to people and this makes me all the more upset that the efficient pharmacy I used prior can no longer service my family needs. I feel stuck with this sub par place that really needs an overhaul.</p>]
[<p><p>I went to pick up my prescription to Walmart Pharmacy in Norwich, CT. The young girl who assisted me was EXTREMELY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. Even the pharmacist gentleman said something to her. When I went back 15 minutes later she was making loud comments about trying to be nice to customers. To what the cashier told her that she needed to be nice. I found it very unprofessional and the fact that people like her are all allowed to work with customers is a shame. I blame this on the manager. I will be taking my business somewhere else where I'm treated with respect.</p></p>, <p>I went to pick up my prescription to Walmart Pharmacy in Norwich, CT.

[<p><p>This is a review of the Walmart Pharmacy on South 31th street in Temple, Tx. This place is constantly slow in filling prescriptions, even when called in on the phone. On the morning of September 27 my wife called in a refill and was told it would be ready Saturday after lunch. We check in to pick up the prescription and are told it will be ready in 20 minutes. This is 29 hours after being ordered. Then they close for lunch. After lunch we check in again. We are told it would be 30 minutes. I said, "Bull, that's what you said 45 minutes ago." Response, "We had lunch." My reply was, "Tough, we have better things to do than spend all afternoon in a Walmart store." The prescription was ready in five minutes.. We are taking our business elsewhere.</p></p>, <p>This is a review of the Walmart Pharmacy on South 31th street in Temple, Tx.

[<p><p>I ordered 3 pills for a cat. The vet was called 8 times by different people, the vet people are returning calls, I called vet because I kept getting notifications that the pharmacy could not get through to them or get a call back, I get told by the vet that they are returning calls. Then, pharmacy tells me they'll try again. I had already cancelled the whole thing to try another place, I tell the pharmacy I cancelled my order and deleted my card. Then, I call to ask about a paper rx. Can't do that, but get told the original order went through, was shipped. How if I cancelled and removed my card information? In fact, I get the order, and my card is charged. HOW? I can't remove my profile and I want it removed.

[<p><p>We ordered our dogs prescription medicine from Walmart RX and paid an additional $22 for overnight shipping. Two days later the order still had not shipped. I called Walmart and they said they faxed the order for approval twice but received no response from our vet. I called our vet and they have received no fax requesting approval for the medicine. A professional pharmacy should follow up when they are unable to reach a Veterinarian office via fax instead of letting the ball drop on their customers.</p></p>, <p>We ordered our dogs prescription medicine from Walmart RX and paid an additional $22 for overnight shipping.

[<p><p>I called to check on an item and was on hold for 6 minutes, eventually called back and was rudely told by the pharmacist Mary that if I hang up, "You'll just wait even longer and put back on hold again." So far it's another 7 minutes. If this is SERVICE you can keep it. Call eventually took a total of 18 minutes after 2 holds of 6 and 8 minutes and then I get all the ** about, "Well we just came back from lunch and there's only 3 of us." DO I CARE??!! I think Walmart makes PLENTY of profit. Maybe they need to spend some on improving CUSTOMER (yes we are the ones who pay) SERVICE.</p></p>, <p>I called to check on an item and was on hold for 6 minutes, eventually called back and was rudely told by the pharmacist Mary that if I hang up, "You'll just wait even longer and put back on hold again."

[<p><p>What happen to my card, I file a police report. I called Walmart corporate and they all agree that they saw me put the card inside the slot but after that it just vanished. As one walmart corporate employee puts it, like magically vanishes. I look at the employee do something then look strange ask that I put my card in after she pull the slot in and my card went missing. I was assured that the machine must have eaten it although it would be the first time because the card was just gone. </p></p>, <p>What happen to my card, I file a police report.

You stop it anyway." So for all walmart customers they don’t just makes your card dissolved or go missing so does some of your prescriptions, count your meds and have back up prescription to prove your refill. Otherwise you might not get them, Go inside because they have a machine that magically makes cards go missing and the only thing they can tell you is they’re so sorry and it got stopped anyway so leave them be. So for future Services I will go inside or change to another drug store. I haven’t been able to go back to this store, my chest tighten up and hands sweat at the possibility of going through this again. I don’t feel safe Now at walmart pharmacy unless I go inside and my card never leave my hand.</p>]
[<p><p>Per my request and my prescription insurance coverage, my doctor writes 90-day scripts. On two occasions Walmart #3990 has not filled the scripts as written. On the first occasion, 3 months ago, I noticed before I left the store. It was corrected and I advised that in the future they should issue the item as the doctor had written the script for. Last week I did not notice until I got home. This time it was for a non drug item and has no chance of inappropriate use. The item comes in boxes of 100 and the doctor wrote it for 200 items total, which would last the required 90 days +10. I wrote a letter a week ago and have not received a response. One 90-day scripts are less expense than 30 day scripts and I don’t have to drive the 60 miles round trip to retrieve as often.</p></p>, <p>Per my request and my prescription insurance coverage, my doctor writes 90-day scripts.

[<p><p>These people treat you as if you committing a crime when you need a RX filled for narcotic type medications. They have gone so far as reviewing all of my medications before filling my RX. This last time was it! The pharmacist refused to fill my RX the way it was written by my orthopedic surgeon. She stated they were giving me too much. I literally just had joint supplement surgery. Who do they think they are to second guess my doctor? Not only that, they talk down to you and treat you as if you are a criminal or a strung out drug addict. I will never use Walmart Pharmacy again!</p></p>, <p>These people treat you as if you committing a crime when you need a RX filled for narcotic type medications.

WHAT THE HECK? Why wasn't it done with the first two? #4 D jumps in with "if it's a controlled substance we don't have any control over when we can dispense it." WHAT. WALMART PHARMACY doesn't have control of dispensing a common pain med?</p>, <p>#5 It's great that 3 of you speak a different language and can make fun of your customers. When you are in the back, looking directly at me, hurry and drop your head and mumble in your language and 3 people burst out laughing (the 4th gets it explained, looks at me and laughs loud and long), it's hard not to know who's the butt of your joke. #6 Everyone was looking a E when I was paying for the prescriptions. You probably don't think I heard you when she said, "I'll take care of this" and you responded "thank you" in a dramatic sigh of relief.</p>, <p>I felt very disrespected. It was extremely apparent that my business wasn't important and my being a customer was the basis of your humor today. The fact that I have a long background in the emergency medical field, and know how unprofessional your department is now, just means I pity your lack of manners and decency.</p>]
[<p><p>Been filling my **, ** and ** through Walmart for over two years now... Every month. Without ANY warning, last minute, they can no longer fill "controlled substances prescribed by my doctor", and of course no further reasoning could be provided. I still don't know if it's because of me, if it's only controlled substances by my Doc, or if they've blacklisted my Doc altogether. These pharmacists know full well that a sudden stop in a benzodiazepine will cause seizures and other serious side effects, including DEATH. Thanks for the heads up! Literally giving me no time to communicate with my doctor until last minute. Going 3 days without ** and ** will more than likely kill a person, so thank you for that... ** YOU!

Called Walmart back and told them and they said, "Oh yeah, we thought you wanted the CASH PRICE." Really!!!! So then ran it though insurance and was told my copay was zero. OMG.

[<p><p>Went in to pick up my RX for antibiotics. Was informed they were in the process of filling it, but would be going to lunch soon, and I would have to wait an hour and a half for it to be ready. Every experience I've had at Walmart Pharmacy has been poor. The staff are rude and show little to no compassion for the patients and their needs. They will NEVER go out of their way to make your experience easier. It is clear that they simply do not care about the people in front of them. In the past I have chosen Walmart simply because the costs are lower than other pharmacies, but Walmart has officially lost my business. I would rather pay a little more at a pharmacy that cares about their patients and treats them with the respect they deserve.</p></p>, <p>Went in to pick up my RX for antibiotics.

No problem here as I planned to pick them up on Tuesday while picking up some groceries. I called Tuesday at lunch and was told they were ready. I thought to double check and make sure that they were filled for 90 days. Told by lady answering the phone that they were. Got my groceries first as there was a long line in Pharmacy and when I did go to pick them up--only two were ready. The other was on HOLD. No one knew why but it would be an additional 30 minutes before it was ready. Did I want to wait!? Told them I would pick them up the next day as I'd been told on the phone they were ready. No apology or concern that they were causing me to wait (despite having a buggy full of groceries) or make an additional trip due to them.</p>, <p>In the past there have been numerous things that have caused me to regret using them as my pharmacy. CVS looking better all the time though a bit out of my way. 1. Prescriptions not ready despite calling them to find out if they are ready. 2. Prescriptions not complete (only 12 tablets instead of 90) despite calling to see if they are ready. Could have told me this on the phone when I called. 3. Prescription not filled because unable to get from manufacture (again no phone call). 4. Not filled for 90 days despite request (and yes this is allowed for this medicine by the insurance). 5. Does not follow up with Dr's office when a new prescription is not called in despite both pharmacy and Dr's office policy is that the the patient NOT call Dr's office for refill. All in all WalMart's Pharmacy would receive a -5 rating from me if possible.</p>]
[<p><p>The prices are good, but it's wait, wait, and wait some more. Even if my doctor calls in the prescription and I wait to pick it up until the next day, it's a long wait. I have tried the online refill, same thing. You should be able to walk in, pick it up and pay and be done. Now if I take a new prescription in and leave it at the window, I expect a wait, but if they say 30 mins, I do not expect to return and be told another 30 minutes.</p></p>, <p>The prices are good, but it's wait, wait, and wait some more.

[<p><p>Used Wal-Mart for nearly a year, go to doctor every 3 months for checkup, and prescription refills. I take 3 meds. My family doctor would fax them to Wal-Mart and I would call and inform them I would come next day to pick up meds. I went 4 times in a year, and not 1 time did they ever have my prescriptions filled even after 24 hours. But 2 of the times they didn't my blood pressure medicine in stock and I would have to wait 2 days for them to get it in stock in order to fill my prescription. I have used CVS, Walgreens with no problems, always filled within an hour. I now use a pharmacy in the same strip mall where my family doctor is located, they walk the prescription over to the pharmacy and usually 15 minutes they have them filled. It is a little more expensive than CVS or Walgreens, but it's 15 miles one way to these name brand pharmacies. So with time and gas, it's more convenient to use a small local pharmacy.</p></p>, <p>Used Wal-Mart for nearly a year, go to doctor every 3 months for checkup, and prescription refills.

[<p><p>Walmart is notorious, for crappie customer service. This includes waiting in line for your pharmacy prescriptions. And then you get up there to cashier to find out it's not ready, they have put it on hold?! What?! So now you have to wait again. Only one cashier?! With 15 people in line?! I hate Walmart.</p></p>, <p>Walmart is notorious, for crappie customer service. This includes waiting in line for your pharmacy prescriptions.

[<p><p>Walmart prices are good, but are constantly changing going up and down. The clerks are usually slow and rude. They will text and say the order is ready and once you drive all the way over there it’s not ready. They even have to call the Dr. I would switch but it’s close to home.</p></p>, <p>Walmart prices are good, but are constantly changing going up and down. The clerks are usually slow and rude.

[<p><p>This rating is primarily for WAL-MART'S MAIL ORDER PHARMACY. WAL-MART'S $10 for 90 day program has ALWAYS come out a bit ahead of the co-pays I would've paid through my two different insurers, that I had to choose from, for my maintenance medication. I've used the MAIL ORDER SERVICE from one state to another, during a sudden temporary address change and flawlessly my VERY NECESSARY medication followed without a hiccup in time.

The only area that LACKS/SUCKS within the WAL-MART PHARMACEUTICAL MAIL ORDER SERVICE is their AUTOMATIC REFILL SYSTEM!!! It has NEVER been consistent, despite a number of assisted &amp; unassisted registrations of my phone number. Unfortunately, WALGREENS has this part down. If you want to rely on this feature, solely for helping you keep up w/ your order.</p>]

They are easy to get to with a drive through I a life saver due to my walking disability. I love my marketplace.</p></p>, <p>I have 3 of the pharmacist on first name basically.

[<p><p>The staff is very knowledgeable, polite and courteous. Have never had an issue since we switched about 8 months ago from Rexall which was terrible. When we were with Rexall it got to the point that we would have to wait sometimes 3-4 days for a prescription. Since switching to Wal-Mart. We can drop off a prescription when we enter the store and pick it up within 1/2 to 3/4 of an hour.</p></p>, <p>The staff is very knowledgeable, polite and courteous.

[<p><p>We just had to change to Wal-Mart Pharmacy beginning Jan. 1, 2019. So far our initial start up and getting prescriptions transferred has been anything but pleasant. The help cannot seem to get their "act together" with all the information given them and put it into motion. I am hoping that as a few more months pass, things will be better. I do know that the prices we are getting from Wal-Mart are 150 percent better than the prices we got from the independent pharmacy we had used for years. One on prescription alone saved us over three fourths as much as we had been paying. That is very welcomed. So due to the money factor, we will continue to trade at Wal-Mart Pharmacy and pray things improve.</p></p>, <p>We just had to change to Wal-Mart Pharmacy beginning Jan. 1, 2019.

[<p><p>I went to Walmart in Memphis Tennessee on Austin Peay Highway. I went to the pharmacy and asked for my ** insulin. The girls saw me waiting and were in no hurry to wait on me. Finally one of them opened the refrigerator, took out a bottle and put it in a sack and handed it to me. You pay for it right then so I put it in my purse got home and put it in my refrigerator. The next day I got it out and looked at it, it was not what I asked for and paid for. I went back to Walmart to get told it was my fault for not looking at it before I walked away and they said no exchange or money back.</p></p>, <p>I went to Walmart in Memphis Tennessee on Austin Peay Highway.

[<p><p>First of all I despise Walmart. I have been waiting all afternoon for a refill on my pain medication. Doctor called in and because it's a controlled substance they can only give me enough for a week. They finally told me this at 8:00pm and I've been in pain all day. Knee replacement. CVS here I come. Also, I admire foreigners who speak our language. I can't theirs. But, please please hire those that speak more clearly.</p></p>, <p>First of all I despise Walmart.

[<p><p>My husband was given a 30 day script from the doctor for a recurring back injury. He went to the Walmart Pharmacy to fill said script. They called him when it was filled with a price of $31.00. Then, he gave them the insurance information. Walmart tech told him that he could only fill a 7 day script. Walmart policy, they said. We explained that the doctor wrote the script for 30 days. We then called the insurance company. They said that the script is covered for 30 days; but, Krishna (the pharmacist) decided to only fill 7 days and the other 21 days would be lost. In other words, go back to the doctor for another script. </p></p>, <p>My husband was given a 30 day script from the doctor for a recurring back injury.

Brittany tried to defend Krishna, so I told her that I wanted to talk to the manager. He called me today and said that it was the insurance company. I explained that I had spoken with the insurance company and that they were not limiting the script to 7 days, nor did they deny that Krishna made the determination. He then told me that I would have to call the insurance company again and have a 3 way call to resolve this problem. We will be using a different Pharmacy from now on. By the way, I had filled the exact same script for myself one month ago without all of this drama. Please do not use Walmart's Pharmacy. They love to argue and place blame on everyone else!</p>]
[<p><p>I have been filling prescriptions at Walmart for years. This time last year, I refilled an available prescription online, got the email saying they were filling it, and then went to pick it up, and they said they had no record of the prescription or me requesting to fill it. After a few frustrated calls to my insurance and the pharmacy themselves, I ended up requesting the doctor's office to send a refill to the pharmacy. No problems again, until today. </p></p>, <p>I have been filling prescriptions at Walmart for years.

I was also told that they had two profiles for me, which doesn't make any sense. Very unprofessional. I ended up having to request the doctor's office send in a new refill (once again) in order for it to be filled.</p>]
[<p><p>I never get my prescriptions filled at Walmart but considering ** is a one time fill and I was at Walmart shopping I decided to drop my prescription off and have it filled while I shopped. Well that was a mistake. 1st of all it took a lot longer to fill than they originally said so I said I would come back and get it tomorrow. Well I ended up in the hospital for almost a week and then for another week after that was having a hard time recuperating and did not go anywhere. I called Walmart pharmacy once I was feeling better and they said they had restocked my prescription because it had been more than 9 days and they would have to refill it. When I went to get it the pharmacist told me that because it was a narcotic and it was a first time fill I would only get 7 days' supply and in the process of waiting for the rest of my prescription they would be calling my doctor to make sure that I should have this prescription. </p></p>, <p>I never get my prescriptions filled at Walmart but considering ** is a one time fill and I was at Walmart shopping I decided to drop my prescription off and have it filled while I shopped.

I said, "This is not a refill. I had a prescription for 90 pills. You only gave me 21." and they said now I would have to get a new prescription which I know my doctor is not gonna do because of how strict the rules are now with opiates. The pharmacist told me that this particular pharmacist should not have told me that I could come back in a week and get the rest because that is not how they worked. I said, "Well he did and now you're not giving me the rest of my prescription?" How do you give a prescription for 90 pills and they only give you 21 and will not give you the rest - is that not up to the doctor to decide how many pills you get per month. </p>, <p>I have been on this medication since 2012. I have never abused it. I am afraid to get addicted to it therefore I do not take it as much as I am supposed to so it's not like I'm needing more ** right this second but I do have severe chronic back pain that some days cannot even walk and when I need my ** I need my ** and I want to have it for when I need it the most. </p>, <p>I am having a hard time wondering why my doctor can prescribe a medication to me that he has been prescribing for years and my doctor knows me more than any pharmacist. I am not an addict. He is trying to get me to take the medicine more often than I do but yet a pharmacist can tell me how much medication I can have because other people have a drug addiction. So in my rant I just want to say never go to Walmart pharmacy because you're gonna get screwed and you're gonna have to go back time and time again until they get it right. OMG I am so angry that I didn't just take the script to my pharmacy. Never will I use Walmart pharmacy again!!!</p>]
[<p><p>I recently moved an hour away from the Walmart where I had my scripts for years. I have severe RA and for 5 months now have been dealing with a very aggressive anterolateral impingement of the left knee for which I received a very minimal narcotic script of only 20 tablets. I didn't even require the medicine but every couple of months, from the Same physician and the same exact strength and dosage. When I moved I transferred my scripts from one Walmart store to another, and as everyone knows they all use the same computer records.</p></p>, <p>I recently moved an hour away from the Walmart where I had my scripts for years.

When I moved I transferred my scripts from one Walmart store to another, and as everyone knows they all use the same computer records.</p>, <p>I am a single mom of 3 and struggle to pay bills as well as drive a vehicle that overheats easily, and when I took the script to the new Walmart (which at this point had filled a sleep medication that is also controlled last month) the very rude pharmacist loudly professed that she didn't feel comfortable dispensing a controlled substance to me and that I was walking with only a slight limp therefore the medication was overkill and I needed to take the script to be filled at the other Walmart that had filled the script in the past. Keep in mind she had the same records as the other Walmart and they are even in the same county. In order to receive the script I had to drive almost an hour to the old location while pulling over three times to keep my car from overheating. </p>, <p>The pharmacist at the old location was very nice and filled it quickly and was very aggravated that I had been treated this way. So my health is in the hands of an egotistical judgmental sadist who doesn't know my medical history or needs. This discrimination needs to be dealt with and pharmacists need to stick to filling legitimate prescriptions instead of acting as if they went to medical school. I have never been so ashamed and embarrassed as she made me feel today. A 3 day very low strength pain medication doesn't mean I'm a damn drug addict and I don't deserve to be treated as such or publicly shamed for my medication needs. Walmart on Winchester road in Huntsville Alabama will no longer have my family's business and will be reported.</p>]
[<p><p>I had the first shingles vaccine in Sept at Walmart. They said I should get the second shot in two months. Went back over and over and they said they didn't have the second vaccine but would call me when it gets in. I received a letter from Walmart saying I needed to go and get the second shot which is needed within 2-6 months from second shot. It has been 4 months. I went in today with the letter and they said they had the second shot. Since it was Jan 2 - my prescription insurance started over and they said I would have to pay 3 times as much as I did on the first one. I asked them if they had this shot for awhile and they said they did. They didn't call me and I could have gotten the shot at the price of the first one. Since I am on a strict budget, I was not able to get the shot today. Evidently they won't be getting any more until August and so getting the first shot was a waste for me because without the second shot it does not protect.</p></p>, <p>I had the first shingles vaccine in Sept at Walmart.

He did tell me I might want to see if another pharmacy would transfer and fill it elsewhere. I called Kroger because I have prescription that are cheaper than at Walmart to see if they can transfer it over and I haven’t heard anything back as of yet. After learning this I looked up the med which I’ve been taking for at least 2-3 years and it says not to stop suddenly due to withdrawal, possible seizure or coma. So does anyone else feel like maybe they should have called prior to me running out so my dr could possibly advise on other choices of meds &amp; I could wean off of the **? If I have issues I will be consulting an attorney! If no one will fill patients have the right to know in advance so they won’t be faced with withdrawal. Had no clue it had those side effects!!</p>]
[<p><p>I have used Walmart for yrs. This week the Pharm refused to fill my Rx until he rec'd the diagnosis from the MD. Note they have been filling same dose for last 5 mos. No consideration of withdrawal, no assessment of symptoms. My MD basis my medication doses on not just my Rx, but also my symptoms. He refused to ever fill a script for me again because I asked him if he would just start writing my scripts. Why pay for MD visit if pharmacist can do it?</p></p>, <p>I have used Walmart for yrs.

[<p><p>I have been to multiple Walmart Pharmacies to fill my prescriptions. I've been very upfront about needing my medication to be name brand and not the generic versions. The generic version they give me is so bad that I might as well not be taking it at all. My scripts have the DAW order specially written on it by my physician. Walmart continuously ignores this order and my requests. I'm afraid if I don't accept the generic medication they try to give me instead, I won't be able to get my script back and will be left without medication of any kind. The one time I checked my medication during the consult and brought up the DAW order, I was told I had to take the generic version or I was not getting any medication and not getting my script back. I don't know what to do at this point. I may need to start videotaping the entire interaction even though I find this incredibly annoying and rude to do to somebody.</p></p>, <p>I have been to multiple Walmart Pharmacies to fill my prescriptions.

[<p><p>Walmart pharmacy Homosassa Fl is a nightmare. Current example for antibiotic called in by my Doctor. First claimed she never called in this med - I have her voicemail confirming the time &amp; location she did phone RX, second I had the on-call Dr call back to get this antibiotic - they claimed they rec'd the call but could not fill RX because they didn’t get the Doctor's first name??!! WTH. Third - just called. Pharmacist glibly replies “NOPE, no antibiotic has been filled“. On my way to the ER!</p></p>, <p>Walmart pharmacy Homosassa Fl is a nightmare.

[<p><p>I've been a regular customer of the main store for years, my parents have been Rx customers their entire lives - a few weeks ago I went to pick up my mom's prescriptions for her. She has crippling arthritis and can't get around well, so she needed me to pick them up. Not only did they not have her scripts ready, but they had NO record of the phone call that they had made the week prior telling her she needed a refill. And then the pharmacist argued that she had no prescriptions ready and that everything related to her pain and mental health were too soon to fill. </p></p>, <p>I've been a regular customer of the main store for years, my parents have been Rx customers their entire lives - a few weeks ago I went to pick up my mom's prescriptions for her.

And then the pharmacist argued that she had no prescriptions ready and that everything related to her pain and mental health were too soon to fill. </p>, <p>Fast forward to today, I decide to take my own mental health prescriptions there - because I have to use GoodRX, I have no insurance, and Walmart was listed as the lowest price. I was treated like a druggie the second I handed my prescription to the tech. The pharmacist quizzed me on why I needed my medication and stated that if I got it filled there once, I'd have to have it filled there from here on out. Not just that, but I was also forced to have ALL of my prescriptions from other pharmacies transferred in. I have to use different pharmacies because prices vary so much but the ones I was using were relatively affordable. Walmart's prices are outrageous on some of my meds but now I have no choice because I need my meds each month. </p>, <p>It was completely unethical to force a transfer of all meds. It's not even about the pharmacist being a complete heel - he had no right to hold my meds over my head. I wish I had said no, but if I did I was literally afraid he'd call every pharmacy in the area and tell them not to fill for me. He had that attitude. I'm not some junkie, Walmart. I'm just a guy that suffers from severe anxiety and major depression. I need my meds so I can function at all. What I don't need is to feel threatened by a pharmacist. I used to work as a pharmacy tech for another company - if any of our pharmacists ever talked or treated a customer like my mother or I had been treated, that would be it. You can try to help all you want with the real threats like opioid addiction, but for Christ's sake just let the rest of us try to live our miserable lives.</p>]
[<p><p>I have been filling my family's prescriptions since the opening of the Fairfax, VA Walmart and we get my husband's 5 heart medications, my asthma medication and my dogs degenerative old age medications. We spend over $1000 per month at the Fairfax Walmart.

This is both an inconvenience and a negative shopping experience.</p>, <p>The prescription was for 20 **. I realize there is a lot of news regarding opiates lately and I agree with the whole concept. However, not knowing why the pharmacist would not fill the prescription is not acceptable in my opinion. I am a 57 year old professional woman and I don't understand why they have no problem filling the $300 per prescription items but a much less expensive medication they refuse to fill without an explanation. I would like another avenue to pursue this complaint...somewhere I will get a response from. Possibly it is Walmart policy to allow the pharmacist to make such a judgment call and if so I object unless there is a reason and a clear way to dispute and resolve the issue.</p>]
[<p><p>Up until 3 months ago, I have had no issues filling my prescriptions at the Wal-Mart in Cookeville, TN. Suddenly, they are refusing to fill them. They stated they needed to know "WHY" I took one of my medications. I explained... In front of other customers in a public setting, which is uncalled for. Then they said they needed to speak to my Dr. to verbally hear why and verify the rx with them. They called, my Dr. verified I have a degenerative issue in my spine and have been on controlled low doses of pain medication to allow normal function. I also cash pay for my medication, however they tried to advise I need a prior authorization. To which I asked if I am Cash paying, no insurance, how was I supposed to get a PA? One week later, 39 phone calls and a complaint filed with Wal-Mart corporate and I was able to receive my medication.</p></p>, <p>Up until 3 months ago, I have had no issues filling my prescriptions at the Wal-Mart in Cookeville, TN.

One week later, 39 phone calls and a complaint filed with Wal-Mart corporate and I was able to receive my medication.</p>, <p>Fast forward to the following month... I completed the process that I was given by the pharmacy previously which was supposed to ensure flawless rx filling. Again they said they had no record of speaking to my Dr. So we jump thru the hoops for 3 days, finally I get the call my medication is ready for pick up... I drive 45 miles to the pharmacy, only to find all are NOT ready. Because a NEW policy was in effect which prohibits the filling of an anxiety medication, pain medication and medication for deep muscle spasms for a customer. Again they spoke to my PCP, my spine specialist as well as my mental health provider, confirming the need for all 3. </p>, <p>They declined to fill all 3 and made me choose the 2 that I wanted. In tears in public at the register. I had to choose between my mental health medication, my pain medication for my spinal and sacral issues and my muscle spasm medication... All while being told... Again in public, by a technician that it was because someone could overdose. When I explained that not if taking the medication as advised and in the lowest doses possible to maintain my health, again I was told, loudly, they would not fill x, y and z together. Using the names. Loud enough for the huge line to hear my health issues and medications.</p>, <p>So I chose... Anxiety medication and pain medication after speaking with my specialist as to what would cause the least harm. Let me say, all of these are medications that you are to wean down from over time, yet 3 months in a row, I have been abruptly cut off from my medication to the detriment of my health and safety. Now we are on month 3. Again, I felt I had followed the processes from both the first month and second month with issues as outlined by the pharmacy... It is now 4 days since I have dropped my prescriptions off to be refilled. Still, I am waiting. On phone call number 12 to the pharmacy and my different specialists to try and figure out what hoop to jump thru next, even after dropping medications to avoid being accused of attempting to overdose, or trying to get more medication than I need.</p>, <p>I have been treated like a drug seeker, a liar, publicly reprimanded and spoken down to rudely by one pharmacist in particular as well as several technicians at this location. When did Wal-Mart Corporation become a physician, a mental health professional, a spinal specialist? When did they supersede a medical doctor? Corporate is not equipped to manage MY health... Is not educated in a way as to determine MY medical needs. They are not doctors. Sadly, the only other option is another large chain retail store for me. Their policies are no better. If you have other options, please use them. And avoid the embarrassing belittling experience Wal-Mart Pharmacy is providing its clientele. </p>, <p>It is as if they feel they are God. These policies affect thousands and thousands of people using their services... To the detriment of everyone's health. My spinal specialist confirmed this is a huge safety and health issue and are at a loss as everything changes with no notification. Wal-Mart can send me hundreds of emails a day on sales and changes in stores, but not once have either myself, any other client I know or my specialist received any notice of change in these policies or an adequate reason why. It disgusts me. Today, I lay in bed all but crippled, because of this company. Shame. Shame on them.</p>]
[<p><p>I am a new customer at the Geer Rd, Walmart in Turlock, I recently changed insurance and was advised to use them. My Doctor sent 3 new Rxs in. Two were filled. One was not my pain meds. When I went to pick up my Rxs I was first told that it was too soon for the pain med to be filled. I advised that it was a new one and past due. I was sent over to discuss reason for delay. I was told that the Pharmacist thought it was a mistake and chose to not fill it. I explained that it was not an error. Then I was told they had to get the diagnosis and reason for Rx. I went back again. This I was told that it was a controlled substance and they had to call Doctor for info. I called again and was told that they had not received the info, therefore it was not filled. I explained that I was in pain and needed the meds. </p></p>, <p>I am a new customer at the Geer Rd, Walmart in Turlock, I recently changed insurance and was advised to use them.

I waited again another day then called my Doctor who has been prescribing this medicine for the last 2 years and knew the procedures. The Dr's office informed me that they had indeed given them the right info, but would call and give it to them again. I received a call from my Dr. the next morning and was told that the Pharmacy had been given the info and the Rx should be filled right away. I waited until 5:30 that evening to call and check for Rx. But was told that the Rx would not be filled until around 11:00 the following day. I won't continue to get my Rxs at Walmart even though it is going to cost me more.</p>]
[<p><p>After 15 years of having my husband's prescriptions filled at the Walmart Pharmacy on Church Road, Kansas City. I was publicly shamed by the pharmacist on duty for his pain relief medication. He proceeded to belittle me, asking me 'what was wrong with my husband' and that 'he's on too much pain medication, he needs to go back to his doctor and get tapered'. I looked at him in shock, what gives a pharmacist the right to give medical advice? I shouldn't have, but being caught off guard, I tried to politely explain that he has a broken/fractured spine, and that if he looked at his record, he can see that my husband already has done his best to reduce his pain medication, going from three (including **) down to 1 MEDICATION! </p></p>, <p>After 15 years of having my husband's prescriptions filled at the Walmart Pharmacy on Church Road, Kansas City.

When did the pharmacists get the 'God Complex' to suddenly administer medical advice and scolding? I took all prescriptions from Walmart, including my prescriptions. After 15 years, they will no longer have my business.</p>]
[<p><p>I have gone the 4436 pharmacy twice, both times the pharmacy tech cannot locate my prescription. The doctor maintains that he sent the prescription twice. The tech cannot find it.

[<p><p>This review is about the Walmart pharmacy in Gardnerville, Nevada. After receiving an email saying my husband's medicine was ready to be picked up I went into the pharmacy. There was a very long line. I thought about walking out and coming back later but my husband was in the car waiting and he was in pain and needed his medicine. He has only been home from the hospital a short time. When I finally got up to the counter the clerk who was very rushed told me they didn't have any prescriptions for my husband. When I got home I called Walmart. They said that they did have a prescription ready for him. I told them what just happened when I went to pick it up and they said it must have been a computer glitch. My husband is very sick. Mistakes like these make our lives even harder. What this means is I will have to get my ill husband back in the car and run down to Walmart for a second time. </p></p>, <p>This review is about the Walmart pharmacy in Gardnerville, Nevada.

The clerk was so emphatic she didn't want to double check to make sure she didn't make a mistake. The line was very long and they had to wait on the next customer. All of my husband's doctors use this place and it will be an effort to change to another one. I just can't get that woman's voice out of my head, there's no medicine here for your husband. Move along so we can wait on the next customer. My husband was in the car waiting that whole time and then I had to go out and tell him they didn't have his medicine. </p>, <p>And I noticed the same person who told me that they had no medicine for my husband also did the same thing to another man ahead of me in line. She raised her voice too like, "You better not question what I am saying." It was awkward but now I wish I would have asked for the manager. I will find another place for my husband's medications after this. If they make mistakes like this it means they are making other ones. Also I don't think they care.</p>]
[<p><p>On 9/24/18 I asked pharmacy if I could get my flu and pneumonia shots there at  Deptford NJ location. The pharmacist, Peter seemed confused, calling me to the front, then back then again. I had my 91 yr old mother with me, and she even noticed it was a little strange. Finally, Peter the pharmacist administered the needles straight forward into my shoulder bone, not off to the side. He commented, it had to go into the muscle and that air got in??? That was about 3pm by 6pm, my entire shoulder blew up, I was in severe pain, I called him and he said takes about 3 days take **. </p></p>, <p>On 9/24/18 I asked pharmacy if I could get my flu and pneumonia shots there at  Deptford NJ location.

[<p><p>To be fair, my initial 2 prescription transaction with the Central Ave., Toledo, OH, Wal-Mart Pharmacy, was just fine. My recent and third experience, on Tuesday evening (10/2/18) was most unacceptable. He is my story: I called the Wal-Mart Pharmacy at 4 something p.m. on 10/2 to assure that they had received the needed prescriptions from my eye doctor. The lady affirmed the script was available, and said it would be ready for my pick-up by 6 p.m. We arrived at the pharmacy counter at 7:45, and I was told by the pleasant lady that is was not ready yet. She apologized. This cashier offered that... "we were horribly busy today". I was told to return within 15 minutes or so and also assured it would be ready then. I was admonished to return to her before the pharmacy closed at 9 p.m. I then returned a half an hour later, at which time I was informed that my prescription was ready for pick-up, and told also how much it would cost.</p></p>, <p>To be fair, my initial 2 prescription transaction with the Central Ave., Toledo, OH, Wal-Mart Pharmacy, was just fine.

Stunned by the delivery of her cold declaration and lack of further explanation, I then inquired as to why I was not told of this by any of the contacts prior to now, and the pharmacist said, "we are short staffed". I went on to ask her when more product would be available and she abruptly said "possibly Thursday". Within a moment or two, the pharmacist typed some more and blurted out, "it's on back order and I can't tell you when or if it might be available". She never offered to contact another pharmacy. She never offered to call me if more product might come in in... </p>, <p>She was most indifferent to my plight and need for this important eye medication. Clearly, her only interest was to terminate any further conversation with me. Finally, I concluded by asking her how I might avoid such confusion in the future, but her annoyance with me became most obvious. Her detachment precluded any further discussion and she simply walked away and back to her keyboard. This Wal-Mart pharmacy fulfillment process was very sloppy and the pharmacist was entirely unprofessional. By the way, I am not only a patient, I am a licensed physician.</p>]
[<p><p>Like the reviews before me I had a very distasteful incident today. My husband was released from hospital after a full foot reconstruction. I dropped off the prescriptions and was to come back in an hour. I actually went back 3 hours later and was told they could not fill the pain pill without the doctor's verbal consent. They told me he wasn’t responding to their call. So I called the office and they paged him. After 25 minutes he responded however we had another issue. Apparently Walmart has set new guidelines and will not fill the dosage of pain pill my husband will need for his foot. </p></p>, <p>Like the reviews before me I had a very distasteful incident today.

We are in our 70s and there are some exclusions to your policy. Also you should not tell your pharmacists if they omit to your policy they could be fired. Walmart should be about helping people not treating them like dogs!!! Very disgusted.</p>]
[<p><p>Almost a year ago I went to pick up my prescription at pharmacy in Hazel Dell Vancouver Washington. As I was waiting I got talked into the flu shot and ammonia shot. Against my better judgment I still got it anyway, wish I never would’ve. The pharmacist said it ministered it. She put the desk on my arm look like a little Band-Aid with a clear window, she told me she was going to give me one shot before the other student want to hurt him more. So she gave me the first one that was supposed to hurt the worst. That was fine. No problem. She gave me the second one which I’m pretty sure it’s the flu shot and I came about 12 inches off the chair. It hurt so bad immediately and there was tingling in my fingers all the way up the back of my head and I said I didn’t feel right. Something is wrong. </p></p>, <p>Almost a year ago I went to pick up my prescription at pharmacy in Hazel Dell Vancouver Washington. As I was waiting I got talked into the flu shot and ammonia shot.

I went home and when I woke up in the morning I was in such pain I would of much rather go through hard labor and childbirth. I had no use of my arm and my hand. I lost the use of my arm and hand for six months. I did go to a urgency care and they couldn’t tell me nothing, now because I have incompetent doctors I had to rehabilitate it myself and a year later they’re finally doing something about my arm. At this point in time I still do not have full use of my arm or hand. I can’t even cross my fingers on my right hand. I am seeking a good attorney. I am damaged for life and they're not getting away with it.</p>]

[<p><p>I got a text on 9/9/2018 that my prescription was ready. That was Sunday, I forgot to go on Monday 9/10/2018. The store closed because of Florence (the hurricane) 9/11/2018 until 9/16/2018. I went to pick it up and they had put it back. They didn't even wait one day before putting it back after just opening today.</p></p>, <p>I got a text on 9/9/2018 that my prescription was ready.

[<p><p>Having used this pharmacy for years because I trusted them to charge fairly, I found out this week how wrong I was. This pharmacy is 25 miles from where I live. My daughter had picked up one of my husband's prescriptions for me on Tuesday as she was in town... I am 84 years old and my husband has only a few weeks to live. They charged her $129.45. I called the next day, explaining that I had checked in my little town of 2,000 folks and the local pharmacy would charge $27.00 for exactly the same thing! So I asked to return the one I can't really afford. They agreed, seeing as it had not even been taken out of the original WalMart bag. </p></p>, <p>Having used this pharmacy for years because I trusted them to charge fairly, I found out this week how wrong I was.

I was told I could I could speak to the manager for that department, however, he was in a different part of the store. No, they did not page him. We could return at 4:30. We did and he had already left for home. After the thousands of dollars expended at this place of business, I would have thought I would have been treated more respectfully. Sadly, I will have to continue to use them for their better prices on other drugs, but I will have the doctor's script from now on so I can compare prices beforehand.</p>]
[<p><p>I never had a problem refilling my meds until today. The pharmacist was rude and told me that she did not feel comfortable refilling my rx until she spoke to my Dr. I told her that my Dr does not take pharmacy calls. She said the nurse could take care of it. I said there is no nurse. It’s just the Dr and a receptionist who is frankly dippy. I could get nowhere with the pharmacist. I have been on this medication for 10 years and now they question a refill. She would not tell me anything. I said that, "I am the patient and I have every right to know why you won’t refill my rx." I’ll call my doctor tomorrow and see if she will call Walmart. Frankly, I’m disgusted. My insurance has Walmart as a preferred provider. If I go elsewhere my cost will increase greatly.</p></p>, <p>I never had a problem refilling my meds until today.

I get a call the day before which is today that I need my medicine and was told he can't fill it and I need to come pick up my script they have had on file.

You should not be able by law to tell someone 2 days before to come get your script. I will be taken this as far as I can so no one else in my situation has to ever go through this.

[<p><p>I have used Wal-Mart Pharmacy for literally years. However, in the last 3 months it has been a real feat getting scripts from them. First, they drug shamed me right there at the counter in front of other customers. My script is not a controlled substance, not a pain medication, etc. It was very embarrassing. It was the Friday before Memorial Day and they said they couldn't fill it until they got verification from my doctor which meant I couldn't get the refill for 3 more day, even though it was a refill for a non-controlled script. (IT may be a HIPAA violation to discuss scripts with a customer in such a manner.) Then they raised the amount of the prescriptions by 40% and told me that my healthcare company had raised the price. </p></p>, <p>I have used Wal-Mart Pharmacy for literally years.

My Wal-Mart Pharmacy has become completely hateful to their customers and are now treating anyone who needs medication like drug addicts. I resent this, plus they outright lied to me! I won't use them again...ever!</p>]
[<p><p>The pharmacies of Walmart are now requiring an additional unneeded step after purchasing a prescription. For prescriptions I have taken for years and not for narcotics. I am now being told it is required by law. I just had to wait an additional 15 minutes after the initial wait time before purchase just for the pharmacy to review my name and verify I had no questions. All of which I had already answered. His is a stupid unnecessary, time-consuming step. Why in the heck would they put this step in as they have. It is a waste and serves no purpose. I HATE Walmart Pharmacy!</p></p>, <p>The pharmacies of Walmart are now requiring an additional unneeded step after purchasing a prescription.

[<p><p>Today Walmart Corporate told me through a pharmacist that they were not going to fill any prescription for a controlled substance... I take a medication for Parkinson's along with other medications, now Walmart is stating that they feel that these medications are not going to be filled. They failed to state a reason? I believe that it is time to start fighting back against improperly informed corporate delinquents, who have no access to my medical records, do not know what my medical conditions are, have no authority to overrule a doctor in the care of my medical conditions. It is time for a class action lawsuit against companies that attempt to subvert the law including the Americans with disabilities act along with other federal laws which appear to have been violated... I would welcome any attorney to begin proceedings.</p></p>, <p>Today Walmart Corporate told me through a pharmacist that they were not going to fill any prescription for a controlled substance...

[<p><p>This review is directed at Walmart Corporation not their underpaid underappreciated employees. Walmart plays this game of charging you full price as often as they can get away with it. It doesn’t matter how recent or often you have updated your health insurance and prescription drug coverage. They will claim that the drug is not covered or that your insurance doesn’t cover it. Most likely both are lies.</p></p>, <p>This review is directed at Walmart Corporation not their underpaid underappreciated employees.

Their computer system tied to the electronic calling system are horrible, and unrelenting. I have been told that all of my prescriptions have been filled and ready. So I go to the store to pick them up and am told, only 1 of the seven is available, two are on back order, two can only be partially filled and we have not filled the other yet. I went there to try and save money. But driving eight miles to be told they are not ready waste enough gas to make shopping there a mistake. Don’t trust Walmart. Don’t believe Walmart. Don’t drive to their pharmacy because you received a call saying everything is ready. Their Pharmacies could not be worse.</p>]
[<p><p>I am a well educated person, was waiting at the pharmacy for a long time, came up that the pharmacist was waiting for the dr to call to clarify a dosage of a laxative for my baby, when I tried to ask her nicely saying if there is two doses can we go with the lower dose, once of a sudden she started screaming and talking at me saying I can’t I can’t I can’t. Everyone in line was giving me that look such as a drug addict was trying to force the pharmacist to give him something. This is not a way to talk to a customer and of course after two hours of waiting time she refused to call the pediatric office and we walked out without the medication. If you care about your time and see that you deserve some respect find another nearby pharmacy to deal with. Pharmacist’s name is: April ** at Walmart Pharmacy Tega Cay, South Carolina.</p></p>, <p>I am a well educated person, was waiting at the pharmacy for a long time, came up that the pharmacist was waiting for the dr to call to clarify a dosage of a laxative for my baby, when I tried to ask her nicely saying if there is two doses can we go with the lower dose, once of a sudden she started screaming and talking at me saying I can’t I can’t I can’t.

[<p><p>I am writing this review so that everyone is aware of what Walmart is doing to the people who find themselves at the end of the journey to relieve their pain and are on pain management. Not one pain management patient I have talked to desires to be where we are. Most if not all have already gone through Xrays, MRI, CAT Scans, injections, physical therapy, psychology and surgeries. We end up on pain management because there are no more treatments!!! This enables us to get out of bed in the morning, go to work to support our families or provide us with enough pain relief that we can enjoy our lives. There is no "high" that we get from pain medications... it's for pain relief only. Our pain management physician has all of our doctor reports and is very well aware of why we are sitting in their office. We do not go to them first... we go to them LAST. </p></p>, <p>I am writing this review so that everyone is aware of what Walmart is doing to the people who find themselves at the end of the journey to relieve their pain and are on pain management.

Now we have a Walmart pharmacist telling us that we can't have anymore pills than a 7 day supply. Are you kidding me? In my case he refused to fill it because I have a pain pump. The same doctor who fills my pump is the same doctor that called in the medication. Since when does a pharmacist override a doctor's orders? For all of you pain management patients out there do not spend another penny at Walmart pharmacy. If they are going to refuse us, turn us away then we MUST turn our business to someone who cares. Walmart is not going to solve this so called ** crisis. What has happened is the DEA can't find the people on the street that are dealing the pills. That is too hard for them. So they are going to come after us because we are in plain sight. </p>, <p>We are registered online, they know what we take and our doctor and pharmacy. It's a lot easier to attack us than to find the street dealers. Unfortunately a side effect from ** medication is dependence. It's an ugly one no different than the side effects from chemotherapy for cancer patients. It doesn't make us drug addicts. It's time we stand up, unite for each other and find a pharmacy that does not judge based on a prescription. I hope every Walmart pharmacist comes to work everyday with no prescriptions to fill. Probably not going to happen but the Walmart pharmacist has 10 less prescriptions to fill from my family.</p>]

But, like my doctor said, "change your pharmacy, YOU ARE MY LIABILITY, NOT WALMART'S!" So, I picked up my script of ** today, and will NEVER, EVER set foot in Walmart again. Btwn the new pharmacy, Hy-vee Costco, and AMAZON... I'LL BE JUST FINE. WALMART has way overstepped their bounds, and will never get another dime from me. It blows my mind they are so concerned for us, mostly baby boomers... yet. Are NOT about the child-labor sweatshops that they use in China to make their products. That is beyond PATHETIC.</p></p>, <p>I am currently without insurance for a couple more months, and was told last month that Walmart would no longer be accepting discount cards for **.

[<p><p>Walmart is a rip off - I will not go back. I went to see an eye doctor today &amp; he looked up online to see which place is cheaper. He showed me the computer screen &amp; the cheapest was $17 at Walmart. When I went in to get it they said it was $42.

When I was a pharm tech I would elevate the call to the dr. But nope we didn't get that service. So I called at 6:30 pm because I thought I would of received a phone call that it was ready but NOPE!

He stated that even if it was a mistake and got corrected, he would contact my dr again and make him give me even less medicine. What gives this pharmacist the right to do that?

They need a dose of reality badly. They have no understanding of my medical history or medical needs based on a prescription. Give me what my doctor tells you to give me and STFU. </p>, <p>I as well as everyone has to be accountable for themselves and do not need multiple layers of idiots telling me something written by the DEA or some corporate attorney. I am the decider at the end of the day what I want to put in my body and for how long. There is so much misinformation, bad data and totally fraudulent studies used to the agenda of a few and we "people" here at the bottom are the victims. Lastly, Walmart pharmacists...this is directed right at you personally...if I treated people the way you do on a daily basis I would be FIRED. You are not God and not a savior. You are a pill counter. Find another line of work. Feel free to treat people like you do now and then you will get the wonderful opportunity to be treated the same as you wait in line at unemployment.</p>]
[<p><p>I contacted my doctor's office asking for a few scripts to be faxed to Walmart Pharmacy on the 23rd, a week in advance, because the Walmart Pharmacy here keeps screwing stuff up. One week later, on the day the prescriptions were to officially be filled, the pharmacy told me they had not received any scripts from my doctor - even though I had verification from my doctor's office on the 23rd, 2 hours after I requested the scripts to be sent to Walmart.</p></p>, <p>I contacted my doctor's office asking for a few scripts to be faxed to Walmart Pharmacy on the 23rd, a week in advance, because the Walmart Pharmacy here keeps screwing stuff up.

But, I didn't want to argue, I just needed my medication. So, I called the doctor's office and asked them to resend the scripts, which they did. I did not receive notification from the pharmacy that the prescriptions were available for pickup. So, I called them to ask what was going on. They said they now had the scripts (now, double the number of them) but, they couldn't give me the prescriptions until they spoke with the doctor - and that they had called my doctor's office to get the verification code. I called mid afternoon, and they said they still hadn't heard anything from the doctor...and then told me that again when I called in the evening.</p>, <p>So, the next day, I called to see what was going on and Walmart said they were still waiting to hear from the doctor's office. I was getting sick of their crap by then so I called my doctor's office personally to explain what was going on. They informed me, again, that the scripts had been sent to the pharmacy, now more than a week ago. I told them Walmart needed some kind of verification. And, I was told they'd given the verification to the pharmacy before I had called anyone at all. So, in the end, I'm sitting there for 3 days, going through withdrawal from my meds, with a mild fever, vomiting, with a migraine, while Walmart had the scripts and the verification codes from the beginning...then got more scripts...and the verification code again. It was like no one there gave a crap about the situation. If I had not been making all those phone calls, nothing would have gotten done. Their apathy was absolutely baffling.</p>]
[<p><p>I have used Walmart's online pharmacy for several years for my monthly supply of medical drugs for Type II diabetes. In the past I have done this by first logging into Walmart.com, then into the online pharmacy where I could check to see how many prescriptions I have remaining and to refill them whenever needed. At some point in 2017 Walmart's online pharmacy changed its online security methodology and from that point I have not been able to be verified or to login at the online pharmacy login site. Each time I was referred to my local Walmart pharmacy store at 1911 Marsha Sharp Fwy, Lubbock, Texas to be "verified" but three trips to my local pharmacy have yet to resolve the login problem.</p></p>, <p>I have used Walmart's online pharmacy for several years for my monthly supply of medical drugs for Type II diabetes.

The first time I was told that my local pharmacy store had somehow deleted my PIN number but the problem would soon be resolved and that I would receive an email by May 11th to verify this resolution. </p>, <p>Having not received any emails from Walmart, today on May 21st, I again called Walmart's Customer Service who again transferred me to the technical people who handle pharmacy tech issues. And again, I was told that my local store has to be a part of resolving this problem which is much more of a problem for older folks who are not as PC literate as myself... Since Walmart's Customer Service has not been able to resolve the issue in two telephone calls and my local pharmacy has not been able to resolve it in three 80-mile round trips there, I may be forced to change my pharmacy if Walmart cannot resolve this technical problem soon.</p>]
[<p><p>Won’t fill pain meds from 2002 injury - I have been in pain management since my work accident in 2002. Only problems I have had filling this is from insurance, or lack thereof.

Nothing unusual YET. I was almost home, when my dr's office called me. She said Walmart says I’m on too high a dose of my pain med. I have been on almost all types since 2002. Including **, ** and early in treatment, **, **. And all in between. I take 4 mg ** up to 5 times a day. This is far from a strong dose. They make 8 mg too. An acquaintance of mine takes 8 mg 3 times a day. I want to know when Walmart became my dr and when they looked over my chart to see everything I have been through since 2002!!! THIS ISNT FAIR AND IT'S NOT THEIR PLACE TO OVERRIDE MY DR’S DECISION.</p>]
[<p><p>I took an Uber from My Pain Management to refill my pain meds from an elevator crash 16 years ago breaking my legs and my back. Never had a problem. They were always easy and pleasant to me. When I gave the prescription to the woman at the drop off window she greeted me by name. Said it would be about 30 to 45 minutes. That's fine. I am not mobile. I was in an electric cart. Went and got a few grocery items. Went back. My prescription wasn't ready, another went by. The Pharmacist said the dosage was too high and he needed to confirm from the Dr.??? It was actually lower than last year and lower what my Dr wanted me to take. </p></p>, <p>I took an Uber from My Pain Management to refill my pain meds from an elevator crash 16 years ago breaking my legs and my back.

I wheeled up to the window and asked him to talk to me in a normal voice and face to face. PLEASE. He was lecturing me on the danger of my pain meds. I told him I was on ** a few years ago and had it changed to something well not so strong. After pointing out to him I am unable to walk he said my name and told me he knew of my condition and then my Dr called and I guess wasn't very nice to him. He came over and said they will be ready in a few minutes. </p>, <p>When I went to pick up and pay this cashier was very rude. Wanted ID. Fine. Well she didn't like my ID even though it is valid and they knew me for 8 years and said They can't sell them to me. OMG. I went nuts and had every manager and customer service person over to see what was going on. This man I had never seen said, "OK this time but never again." This is the only pharmacy even close to me and most don't deliver anymore. Now I have to pick up my meds for anxiety and Parkinson's. I am totally afraid to go in there again. After 8 years with them They treat me like a drug addict.</p>]
[<p><p>On several occasions I've tried to fill/refill prescriptions only to be told they are out of stock. What's worse is they say they don't know when inventory will be received. How can a business that absolutely affects the health of consumers not have inventory??? I was without a thyroid medication for nearly a week before. Now, I can't get a prescription for my daughter filled because of this nonsense and she's been without it for 3 days. I've had to call my daughter's pediatrician to see if they will send it to another pharmacy. Walmart tells me they don't know what they're receiving on a daily basis and I'm supposed to call every day to see if the drug is in. No thanks, I'll take my chances with a reputable company going forward.</p></p>, <p>On several occasions I've tried to fill/refill prescriptions only to be told they are out of stock.

[<p><p>Took a legitimate prescription to the new Neighborhood WalMart in Murrells Inlet SC located at Frontage Road. The pharmacist called me 5 minutes after I dropped it off angrily stating a schedule 2 med from out of state could not be filled in SC nor at any Walmart, it was the policy. I've been filling this for years without incident. When I arrived I was told the "city where the Rx was written is filled with clinics that write this stuff and hand it out like candy". I'm apparently lucky "she didn't keep my Rx and report me" (for what? trying to fill a prescription?). I asked if she called and verified the Rx but was told "she didn't need to because who knows what kind of relationship I have with this doctor" What the heck? </p></p>, <p>Took a legitimate prescription to the new Neighborhood WalMart in Murrells Inlet SC located at Frontage Road.

We can fill that.” So she LIED in addition to harassing me! They may not have to fill the prescription (at their discretion) but lying and slander should be off the table. Blatant harassment and profiling and all kind of loud talking about my med, my doctor and our apparent illegal ways. Checking to see if HIPAA violation occurred.</p>]
[<p><p>So I have been taking opioid for several years due to major back problems. These last few months of filling my script at Walmart pharmacy had been a pain. They lecture me, make me wait forever and barely want to hand the medication over. I do not abuse the meds. I take them as prescribed by my doctor but they still treat me like I'm an addict. I have all the verification I need from the doctor, insurance company, etc to have this medication legally every month. I went to get it filled today and they told me 30 min it would be done. Check back in 30 and they say they will not fill because they no longer fill prescriptions from my doctor's office. I just don't get it since that has never been a problem before. I think they just make up excuses not to fill prescription pain meds for anybody these days.</p></p>, <p>So I have been taking opioid for several years due to major back problems.

[<p><p>I dropped 2 prescriptions to the Walmart Pharmacy on Philips Hwy-Jacksonville FL. One was new (a $4 antibiotic) and the other was a refill of an anti-fungal that I first got filled at the Walmart on Normandy Blvd. It took 2 days for the Philips Hwy Walmart Pharmacy to fill the antibiotic and 5 days to fill the anti-fungal. When I went to pick up the anti-fungal (14 pills, 100mg) I was told the cost was over $91. I disagreed, explaining that it was a $39 Rx refill that I'd already had filled once at the Walmart Pharmacy on Normandy 3 weeks ago and that 2 days prior the Philips Hwy pharmacist had already confirmed the $39 cost for the refill. The tech leaned over the register at me and said "Well, this ISN'T the Walmart Pharmacy on Normandy, this is the Walmart Pharmacy on PHILIPS." I was also told I could not use my Good Rx coupon. I told this Tech that the price isn't right and to cancel the RX, I would transfer it back to the other Walmart Pharmacy. </p></p>, <p>I dropped 2 prescriptions to the Walmart Pharmacy on Philips Hwy-Jacksonville FL.

By the time I got there (25 minutes) the RX was ready at the $39 cost AND they applied my Good Rx coupon so the final cost was $25.94. They couldn't explain to me why the cost was almost double at the other location, or why the other Walmart Pharmacy would not take the coupon. They were just as baffled as I was. I'm still bothered by this discrepancy in cost. This morning I researched all Jacksonville pharmacies for this particular Rx and found the cost NEVER exceeded $39. There's no insurance in play here either. This is a straight cash pay. </p>, <p>There needs to be a full investigation into Walmart pharmacies potentially overcharging their less savvy customers, like seniors or patient advocates or INSURANCE companies for that matter. 100% markup on a generic drug without a rational explanation? Where is the oversight? This is unethical and definitely diminishing people's quality of life. It's gouging the sick. Heinous. Be your own advocate! Always shop your Rx on with an app like Good Rx, call multiple pharmacies or do an online search so that you know what you should be paying vs what the bad pharmacies try to get away with charging you!</p>]
[<p><p>I went to the Walmart at I-10 East Freeway @ Freeport St to have my prescription for my pain medicine filled, as I have every 2 weeks for the last 2 years, to be told I needed to have my Doctor fax over my treatment plan. I physically pick up the prescription from my doctor's office and carry it to this same pharmacy every 2 weeks. My doctor did not feel comfortable passing my medical information via fax, anyone would have access to it which is a violation of my rights under HIPAA. The pharmacist refuses to fill my prescription with no good reason. I have seen this doctor since I was 15 years old, I'm 46 now, I think that qualifies as a good doctor/patient relationship. </p></p>, <p>I went to the Walmart at I-10 East Freeway @ Freeport St to have my prescription for my pain medicine filled, as I have every 2 weeks for the last 2 years, to be told I needed to have my Doctor fax over my treatment plan.

I do not have insurance as my job does not provide health insurance during probation period so I pay cash. I do not try to have my prescription filled early since I take it as prescribed and my doctor would not release it to me early even if I wanted to. This is ridiculous as to so many innocent people with chronic pain are having to suffer due to pharmacists trying to play the role of doctors. If you want to be a doctor, go to med school. I agree there is an opioid problem but do your research on patient history in your own computers at Walmart. If you see consistency with patients on these meds, don't treat them like abusers. Look for the inconsistencies.</p>]

[<p><p>To make a very long story short, following several months, well no, years of unprofessional service I finally decided to voice my concerns with corporate. I was assured that the situation would be dealt with. Unfortunately I believed this. Recently when I called to ask a question the person I spoke with wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise, we were going nowhere as we were now raising OUR voices, so I hung up. The individual actually called me back within minutes and told me to never come into that pharmacy again as I wasn't welcomed there and hung up!! Can you say Human Rights issue? This store in Niagara Falls NY has the most ignorant, non-professionals that one can EVER imagine.

Even though this was the story and Walmart had been told of my health issues they called my PCP to inform her that I was receiving controlled meds from several doctors. The issue is, my PCP prescribed my anti-anxiety and the pain doctor prescribed my pain drugs. </p>, <p>I'm on the lowest amount of pain meds that a patient can take and still get relief and one antianxiety pill a day. I battle depression and am in counseling trying to get relief. Due to the pharmacy's blatant act of misinformation my PCP became nervous and worried about being turned into the DEA so changed my meds even changing one to longer acting which causes lethargy throughout the day and causes more depression. The days of so many hands in the pie of each patient has now messed up the entire system. I am so disappointed in what the govt has done due to back alley illegal drug sales that I believe I'm just another victim of those selling drugs on our street corners.</p>]
[<p><p>On March 7th, I went to the Walmart at 3829 US Hwy 77 in Corpus Christi Texas. I went to the pharmacy there to pick up two prescriptions called in by my doctor. The clerk that waited on me was rude and would not listen to me. I told her I had two prescriptions to pick up and I gave her my name and date of birth. After she checked, she came back and insisted that I had 3 prescriptions to pick up. I told her no that there was only two and she argued and said that the doctor must of added a generic and besides it was in with my other medicine. She was rude of course and told me I had to take all of them and that the extra prescription was on five dollars. So to cut down on the conflict from her, I paid for them and left. I took the meds when I got home for my nightly dosage and got sick and sat back and passed out. </p></p>, <p>On March 7th, I went to the Walmart at 3829 US Hwy 77 in Corpus Christi Texas.

What I had taken was a muscle relaxer. It interacted badly with my other regular medications. I have reported this to the corporate office and the Texas Board of Pharmacy. I've not heard back from anyone on the matter except the pharmacist that filled the order, demanding that I bring it back. My next report will be to the FDA I guess. Whatever the case, you can't trust their pharmacy because they will give out anything just to suit them. I will never go there again and I advise that you don't either.</p>]

[<p><p>Just left the doctor's office. Was prescribed 10mg of ** once a day. Picked up my medication. Went home. Ate supper. Popped a pill.

Well why would you do that to a person who reads a prescription bottle when they just left the doctor's office and she told you how to take this pill. This was an awful experience. I have anxiety which is why I'm taking **. I had an awful night and am having an awful day. Side effects are amazing. No one should have to go through this. Do not trust. Read and now do we trust what's in the bottle if it is the drug it's supposed to be. Very bad experience and you wonder why I didn't read it why should I.

I have been taking ** for more than three years and have had this issue numerous times! I am out of medication which I SHOULD NOT JUST STOP! Walmart never called my doctor! I sent them an email and yet I went to pick up my script and it was not filled! They also tried to blame the doctor! They now have a policy at this store in Norwich, NY that they REFUSE TO FILL MY SCRIPT UNTIL 30 days add ER last fill/refill! This is causing me so much stress and aggravation! I have been without my meds, even though my insurance would accept filling the script a couple days prior to 30 days! Why is Walmart policing my doctor-prescribed medication that’s I HAVE NO HISTORY OF ABUSING! They literally stated “they were the addiction police,”. What on earth is happening! If I lose a pill I am out of luck and considered an abuser! </p>, <p>Walmart has no right to determine when I should get my meds if my Doctor approves the script and the insurance will fill/refill a couple days prior to expiration of last refill! They told me to GO TO THE ER BECAUSE OF THEIR NEGLIGENCE AND INCOMPETENCE! No wonder why, as a chronically ill person, my medical bills are astronomical AND I HAVE INSURANCE! Please explain to me how Walmart can arbitrarily refuse to provide necessary meds when there would be no illegality or repercussions! I have to drive top miles to this Walmart and my doctor even place a note on my chart that this script can and should be refilled! I have been without my medication for days now and request you contact Walmart’s Pharmacists at the Norwich store to remedy this continual problem. Causing me tremendous stress!</p>]
[<p><p>Why is it that when you pay for your script you have to go stand in another line so the pharmacist can bag it. What the hell is this. Stand in line to get script then pay then stand in another line while pharmacist takes it out of the bag then puts it back in the bag. What a waste of my time. First I was told it was a state law. LIE. Then it was Walmart policy. Who make this policy. I refuse to go to another line and raise holy hell till they give me my script.</p></p>, <p>Why is it that when you pay for your script you have to go stand in another line so the pharmacist can bag it.

[<p><p>Walmart Pharmacy Johnsburg, IL - I have been filling my prescription at Walmart for years, I take ** for anxiety. My doctor does NOT provide refills so I have to physically go into the office every month to get a prescription. Brought the script in the same day doc wrote it like I've done for years, the staff told me my insurance declined to fill it as it was 4 days early. </p></p>, <p>Walmart Pharmacy Johnsburg, IL - I have been filling my prescription at Walmart for years, I take ** for anxiety.

Then they told me the computer wouldn't fill it, well, computer has filled it this way for years so another lie, bottom line, they have a new pharmacist (wouldn't tell me the name) who has been hassling people on refills. She has decided since script was filled last 2/9 to hold it until 2/8 even though it is a NEW script the doc just wrote. Seeing doc every month allows them to know how often it's filled. If they felt it was too early they wouldn't have written it, pharmacist continually takes it upon herself to play doctor and decline not just mine but other people's as well. Will be leaving Walmart pharmacy AND shopping center as it is no longer convenient and I don't like being lied to and having a pharmacist doctor wannabe override my personal doctor's prescription!</p>]

[<p><p>I have transferred two prescriptions to two other pharmacies. The most recent was for a refill of a drug I use when symptoms set in. I have insurance. The price for six of these pills at Walmart was $42.00 for six pills. I asked if there was a generic replacement. Their answer was NO. I left the store, went home and researched the pill I am taking and guess what? There is a generic for it. The next surprise came when I went online and found a discount card thru Walgreens for $82.50 for 30 pills making it $2.75 per pill versus $6.08 per pill. I had my prescription transferred to Walgreens. Went back to Walmart and showed them my receipt from Walgreens and they countered with 36.50 for 6 pills.</p></p>, <p>I have transferred two prescriptions to two other pharmacies.

Taking into consideration the trouble my doctor has to go thru to switch pharmacies and there you have the problem and complete waste of time and money. Thank goodness I am healthy enough to pursue getting a fair deal. I am thinking of the sick and disabled and wonder what is happening to them. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK AND RESEARCH ALL YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PRICING AND GENERIC ALTERNATIVES!!</p>]
[<p><p>I have logged in innumerable times to this site. All I wanted this time was a printout of my 2017 subscription purchases.

WHAT???</p>, <p>I called my pharmacy where they know my voice (my husband and I buy all our prescriptions there -- we account for 10% of their business, I am sure!) They call me by name but no, they cannot grant me access without my picture ID and signature. So I ask for the number of online technical support. I call and explain that I am miserably sick with a bad code and just need my 2017 report. They ask me all sorts of questions only I would know including a prescription number. Then they ask me the same for my husband's account. </p>, <p>She is satisfied. She says she will forward all my info to the people in charge of access and that I should hear from them within 5 business days. 5 BUSINESS DAYS!!! I want the report NOW! My frustration and anger knew no bounds. I have threatened to take our business elsewhere -- to Harris Teeter just down the road and much closer than Walmart. But my husband and I like the people at this pharmacy so I will give them one more chance. But the dumb bozo who, without any notice to me, put a "new level of security" on their pharmacy website should be fired. </p>, <p>The least they could do is have every pharmacy check-out person explain the situation and ask if the customer wants to initiate the access process WHILE THEY ARE STANDING RIGHT THERE!!! No, they wait for you to really need something from their website BEFORE they tell you about this "new security level." How stupid can they be. Can't they think through anything before making changes??? THINK LIKE A CUSTOMER and figure out how to make their Walmart experience EASIER instead of damn frustrating! If I could give you a minus 10 stars, I would.</p>]
[<p><p>The pharmacy assistant at the register, Arvealetta, was rude and dismissive. She has been unprofessional on several occasions and continues to be so.

For that reason, I have decided to remove my business from your pharmacy and will encourage my family and friends to do so if/when they encounter this woman's rudeness.</p>, <p>Today when I went to pick up my prescriptions, she rudely said to me, "The prescriptions were not ready. The pharmacist needs to read them, don't know when or how long it will take, so I will let her know you are here waiting," gonna take the next customer and motioned me to step aside. I said, "Well can you just ask her how long so I will know when to come back," she sad, "I already told you I don't know, next..." I said, "You can't just ask her..." just then the pharmacist, Nahimini, said softly, "It will just be about 5-10 mins," I turned to her and said, "Ok great, I will be back then."</p>, <p>Later when I came back to pick up the prescriptions she continued to talk loudly about me to another co-worker and by saying that lady right there. Have no problem if you want to talk to your coworkers about your experiences with clients, but this woman was blatantly doing this loudly so I could hear her and looking right at me. So that's when I went to the customer service desk where the manager said, "We don't control the pharmacy, they are a separate vendor," so I went to the pharmacy manager who just happened to be Nahimini, in which she tried to make excuses for her behavior. This would have been accepted if it was the first time but it wasn't. I'm actually praying for this woman in hopes she can see the way she is treating people and change her ways.</p>]
[<p><p>The pharmacy had one of my prescriptions ready to go but it had to be held for a few days due to refill guidelines. The pharmacy admitted they took the script off the shelf and used to for another patient. When I went to pick up my medicine I was told they were out. This was Wednesday the 7th, after I told the pharmacy that was unacceptable they gave me 7 pills, and stated the rest would be in on Thursday. I called Thursday and they said it would be Friday. It is Friday now I am running out of my medicine and the pharmacy tech said it could be as late as Monday. The pharmacy didn’t even call me, I had to call them! I would like to know the legality and duty the pharmacy has to fulfill orders.</p></p>, <p>The pharmacy had one of my prescriptions ready to go but it had to be held for a few days due to refill guidelines.

[<p><p>I'm the sole caregiver for my grandparents and they use Walmart Pharmacy. For the past two years I have been taking care of them and also have the very unfortunate task of going to and dealing with Walmart. My grandfather only has a few prescriptions that only need refilled every once in a while, however my grandmother is a diabetic, along with having numerous other necessary medications. I am in the pharmacy at least once a week, if not, three or four times. I know that all but two of the employees in there are all completely clueless, including the pharmacist. Funny enough, the one employee who is the most ignorant and rude is the only one that doesn't have their certifications on the wall. Kind of makes me wonder.</p></p>, <p>I'm the sole caregiver for my grandparents and they use Walmart Pharmacy.

Funny enough, the one employee who is the most ignorant and rude is the only one that doesn't have their certifications on the wall. Kind of makes me wonder.</p>, <p>Anyway, I am at my wit's end with them. They always call the house when a prescription is ready for pickup and give the cost, most of which is usually no charge. Yet when I go over to pick it up, lo and behold, there's a charge. It does me no good either way, because they won't ever listen to me, so I either have to pay and take my grandmother in later to get her money back, or just do without the medication and my grandmother has to take the time to call them and speak to one of the clowns working the pharmacy that the prescription does not cost anything. Anyway, this makes me livid because they are wasting my time and gas by having to drive in, go home empty handed and come back a second time and get the prescription.</p>, <p>When they aren't trying to take advantage of me and attempting to get me to pay for something that is free (probably assuming I'm some stupid young boy) they are refusing to either fill the prescription or refusing to have the prescription. They once refused to fill a prescription for EIGHT days. This was for no reason other than them wanting to be difficult. Not only that, but this was insulin. A new prescription for insulin. They tried to blame everyone under the sun but themselves, first the insurance company, then the doctor, then again the insurance, then her, then the doctor again. They never did claim responsibility for that, but they finally did fill it when she threatened to switch to a different pharmacy.</p>, <p>As I mentioned before, they call to inform of a prescription that is ready for pickup. Their new favorite thing to do is call, say a certain medication is ready for pickup at no charge. As I'm the only one driving, I have to go over there and pick it up. When I get there they either say it's not ready, or it is ready but for some reason (that they refuse to explain) they can't give me the prescription. I like to call them out on their **, and tell them that they literally just called and said it was ready. Once again, another unnecessary trip and more of my extremely valuable time wasted.</p>, <p>After realizing I could just use the drive thru, I started doing that. I absolutely hate having to go inside Walmart, and I shouldn't have to fight crowds just to get a prescription. I also despise having to even look at the people working in there, I hate all but two of them. They actually stopped screwing up everything when I started using the drive thru for the first four or five times. I think now they realized who I am without actually seeing my face, and they have been doing everything in their power to ensure I leave ** off. First it was refusing to give me the medications. Now it's make me 5 minutes when I hit the call button until someone even acknowledges me, saying "be right there", then not coming back, then another person saying "sorry, one moment", followed by another five minute wait before being helped. Then finally being helped, only to be told I can't pickup the prescription. </p>, <p>Oh and in the 20 minutes they have me waiting, helping every other person to use the second drive thru lane. I actually timed this, and from the moment the other cars pulled up, rang the call button, and drove off with their prescription was less than 4 minutes total. This place I'm pretty certain has a personal grudge with me, I know for a fact two of the employees do because they saw a post I made on social media in a community group page about some of the horrible experiences I've encountered, just trying to make the public aware of what really goes on here. These two definitely treat me with a ** poor attitude anytime I get stuck with them, the other employees aren't too bad (just clueless). It's really unnecessary for them (Walmart Pharmacy as a whole) to conduct themselves in this manner.</p>, <p>I don't know if they are doing this on purpose. I would have never had an issue with them if they could just do their job correctly. I'm tired of having to make multiple trips over to Walmart, and having to deal with these morons each time, because they keep messing up everything. I have counted and the last ten times I've been here, I've only had ONE time where they got everything right. A 10% rate is unacceptable. They need to be evaluated, I'm sure if the Delaware Board of Pharmacy saw how they really operate, they'd lose their license immediately. </p>, <p>I would highly recommend going to literally any other pharmacy, Walmart will never apologize to me for anything, because that would mean they'd have to admit they were in the wrong. Walmart doesn't care about your health, only your wallet. Anyway, I don't use Walmart Pharmacy myself. I've been trying my hardest to convince my grandmother to get her to switch her and my grandfather over to a different pharmacy. It really ticks me off that she continues to use a pharmacy that only see her as a dollar sign, in my opinion. </p>, <p>With a REAL pharmacy (such as CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens, local small town pharmacy, etc.) they know you on a first name basis and are friendly, have your medication ready when they see you walk in, and if they mess up they apologize for the error and fix it. They don't try to rip you off, they don't call you and have you come in for a prescription that isn't ready, they don't play games. I would rate it at zero stars if that were an option. Don't be fooled by Walmart Pharmacy's cheap prices and generics, IT IS NOT WORTH THE HASSLE!!!</p>]
[<p><p>At the beginning of the new year I brought in my new Part D insurance cards to start using Walmart Pharmacy for the new year for 2018. At the time I did not have an Rx to fill but the gal at the pharmacy took the cards to put on file. Soon after my doctor called in an Rx and the pharmacy used my old Rx card to fill the Rx. I found this out before I went to pick up my meds and got it fixed with the pharmacy over the phone. When I went to pick up my meds they still had not used my new cards AND they implied that I gave them the wrong cards. They were beyond condescending... The pharmacist laughed at me and asked if I needed to have someone explain how this worked.</p></p>, <p>At the beginning of the new year I brought in my new Part D insurance cards to start using Walmart Pharmacy for the new year for 2018.

This is no way to treat a paying customer. The store manager told me to never come back to that Walmart. I reported them to the agency for Civil Rights and to Walmart Corporate. If it wasn't for my current insurance which is Humana Walmart I would switch to CVS in a heartbeat. I NEVER had problems with them. BEWARE OF WALMART if you want to be treated with respect. I wound up using Humana mail order which is cheaper anyway. In my opinion Walmart has little to no class and needs a course in customer service.</p>]

I rarely pick up my own meds. My husband does that and when I asked about access to the Online Pharmacy (on the rare occasion that I get to pick up my own meds) because I was being locked out, my Pharmacist had no idea what I was talking about! Next thing that will happen is that my husband can't pick up my medicine because they can't verify he's my husband! And GOD FORBID that "someone unverifiable" takes home my meds...which is for Migraines! I am seriously thinking of switching Pharmacies. We only chose Walmart because it was close to my husband's work. It may be time for my family to change to a reliable local Pharmacy that is not a corporate box store but only a Pharmacy that focuses specifically on the needs of its customers instead of seeing how far they can push them and have them stick around!</p>]

[<p><p>They have no Quality Assurance (QA) in processing their online orders. Most of the time their system is broken. If you order a refill that requires a new prescription from the doctor, the transaction is removed from an online status and moved to a manual status. Once there, even after the new prescription is received, they do not process it automatically. Instead, if you signed up for telephone notifications they are suppose to call you and verify that you actually want the drug. Of course if you did not sign up for notifications, the transaction is put on hold. So, after you run out and call them, then they try to process it, but the manual data they have does not match what is in the online system, so all their data (credit card info) is outdated and the transaction fails.

[<p><p>Went online like I always have to view my pharmacy orders. Walmart has instituted a new log in that requires a security code. After signing up and logging in, it tells you that you must sign in as a guest and pick up your medications at your local pharmacy. THIS IS AN ONLINE PHARMACY. There is no local Walmart for me to pick up prescriptions and I didn't want to order anything - just view my account. The customer service department I called says they are aware of the issue but they can't give me any information about my account due to privacy issues. It could also take up to 2 days for them to contact me. So, let me get this straight. I can't access my medications online and Walmart can't either. And I have to wait until they get around to me in order to figure it out! This will undoubtedly turn into a major legal issue for Walmart down the line. I hope they get their crap together because this is completely unacceptable.</p></p>, <p>Went online like I always have to view my pharmacy orders.

And I have to wait until they get around to me in order to figure it out! This will undoubtedly turn into a major legal issue for Walmart down the line. I hope they get their crap together because this is completely unacceptable.</p>]
[<p><p>This is the second time Wal-Mart Pharmacy has withheld my medication unless I give them medical information. It isn't even the pharmacist who is asking the information. It is an employee in a smock. I just saw my primary care physician and they called in the medication for me. It is a topical cream. I have been on it for 3 years and suddenly they are refusing to refill my prescription unless I answer medical questions.</p></p>, <p>This is the second time Wal-Mart Pharmacy has withheld my medication unless I give them medical information.

[<p><p>Today was the 2nd time Walmart has been OUT of my medications (**)... And they tried to give me a $50 ** instead of the $10 (3 month) one when they finally came in. I refused so they took it back and gave me the $10 one. When I asked what the difference was, they said they changed manufacturers for the $4 and $10 pills. They're still out of **, it's been about 2 weeks. I asked why, they said they're very busy and having trouble keeping up.</p></p>, <p>Today was the 2nd time Walmart has been OUT of my medications (**)...

[<p><p>For the last two months my Dr has got me in a few days early so when I left they put my medicine on file. I was told that they would be filled on a certain day so I go expecting to pick up when I get there. They then tell me they're out of stock!!! Now by this time I'm completely out of my meds and now they're saying they have to order... This doesn't make sense to me.

[<p><p>Beware. You get what you pay for. Went there to save money on my prescriptions. I don't understand how can they not have your order ready after you get a email. Then they have no record of me placing my order online. Had to go back to the window to re-order them again and after waiting for a very long time I go up to see if they are ready and no one was even working on them or received my order yet again they asked me DID you order them. I just told them forget it I will go somewhere else. They really need to get their crap together. And we trust these people with our lives.

[<p><p>I have always dreaded filling my prescription at Walmart because every tech behind the counter thinks that they are better than you, especially if you're filling something like **. I am so sick and tired of being judged for having this vice. They lied to me on this occasion saying they sent my prior authorization to my doctor. This was Thursday... So Friday it's obvious nothings gonna get done and I fill a 3 day script for 60 dollars. Monday comes along and I call my doctor around noon and they say they still haven't received the authorization. I call the pharmacy and they say it usually takes a week. They ask where the doctor is out of again and the fax so clearly they never sent it. Once again your neighborhood Walmart discriminating its paying customers. Now I'm sick from withdrawals and it's on you Walmart so ** you.</p></p>, <p>I have always dreaded filling my prescription at Walmart because every tech behind the counter thinks that they are better than you, especially if you're filling something like **.

[<p><p>I filled my pain prescriptions here occasionally because I picked up groceries. But the service and communication was very poor. The pharmacy website is horrible. My Rx I dropped off yesterday was delayed and I was told to called them next day after waiting for 30 mins. They don't even offer to contact me at all. After more than 14 hours, I hear nothing from them! Lazy employees and careless system. They don't seems to be happy with their jobs like most of them working here. One more thing, I have just found out the cost for my pain pills was 60% more than at W. I am going back to the real pharmacy with professional system and attitude.</p></p>, <p>I filled my pain prescriptions here occasionally because I picked up groceries.

[<p><p>I went to Wal-Mart for my shingle shot and sat there for 1.5 hrs. When they pulled the gate for lunch. One of the assistants came out and said, “Oh you with the shot it’s not authorized” and walked away. I'M on SS disability and have Humana insurance so when I called them I was told by Humana it had been authorized 1.5 hrs ago. I called the store manager and he was told the assistant though I couldn't afford it. The manager then gave me a $20 dollar gift card and apologized. My spine is so bad it takes me15 minutes once I'm in the store to get to the pharmacy. Shame on Wal-Mart.</p></p>, <p>I went to Wal-Mart for my shingle shot and sat there for 1.5 hrs.

[<p><p>I have been going to the Walmart Pharmacy for five years now. This last year has been horrible. I am using a new drug and they never had it stocked. I would order it with other prescriptions go pick them up, come home minus that new drug and no one told me. Very inconvenient. I live out of town and not close to the Walmart. Another thing happened that we are just now figuring out. I thought this was my fault for the last few weeks. It is not, at all. About a month ago my doctor called and added to a prescription. Well Walmart dropped what I needed and used the new one the doc called in. No one let me know. I kept using the old prescription use of 2 tablets and ran out a few weeks early. This affected my sleep. For 2 weeks there it was messed up without the drug. Weeks later it is now getting straightened out. I switched to another pharmacy. Enough is enough.</p></p>, <p>I have been going to the Walmart Pharmacy for five years now. This last year has been horrible. I am using a new drug and they never had it stocked.

[<p><p>I tried using the Walmart app to refill my prescriptions but it does not work. When placing my order it sends a text telling me the order will not be ready for another two weeks.

Sometimes when I place my order through the app the pharmacy does not receive it at all. Needless to say I will not be using the app at all to refill prescriptions.

[<p><p>My doctor called in my pain medication last week Tuesday for my acute chronic pancreatitis to the boiling springs SC Walmart. They didn't want to fill the script last Tuesday because they were either prejudice or ridiculous because the pharmacist said the medication was too expensive to process the script. If you thought the medicine was too expensive, can't your brain process the thought of following up with the doctor that wrote the script. That's the excuse I got when I called Thursday morning to find out where my medicine was. Then when I complained Thursday, they claimed they ordered it Thursday and it would arrive Tuesday. Then when I called this morning Tuesday and demanded to speak with the store manager because pharmacy kept hanging up, or letting the phone just ring, he went over to talk to them. </p></p>, <p>My doctor called in my pain medication last week Tuesday for my acute chronic pancreatitis to the boiling springs SC Walmart.

What is wrong with these sick people that would cause a person to not care that another is in so much pain. Shame on you. I hope one day you know the pain that I am in. I will never shop at Walmart again. This was 100% prejudice or 100% incompetence.</p>]

Also, now, they tell me I cannot fill my ** during the same amount as the **, even though, I only use the ** for extreme pain during menstruation and I have Crohn's disease and it helps me, but they're saying they can't do it. I've had it with them! I've never had such poor service and made to feel like a Junkie, even though I've NEVER filled it early ever! I'm sick of them. It was embarrassing and disgusting.

[<p><p>I have been using WM's pharmacy for many, many years and have found the pharmacists very helpful and patient. I have no complaints about them at all. The other employees of the pharmacy can be hit or miss and are often sloppy, causing us to drive to the pharmacy to pick up an item only to find out it's not ready after all but I usually avoid this by asking to speak to the pharmacist about my orders - which they themselves have recommended. I often order my refills online but lately - since September 2017 - I have not been able to log into my pharmacy account. I have worked with online customer service and was even sent to an "escalated" type of help but they ended up telling me I had to "verify" my account in the pharmacy and things would start working. The problem is the pharmacists have not heard a word about this. Just wondering if anyone else is suddenly having problems accessing their pharmacy account.</p></p>, <p>I have been using WM's pharmacy for many, many years and have found the pharmacists very helpful and patient.

When I picked up my meds I called back to the pharmacy alerting them that my meds look different, they said; "We changed manufacturers", so I took the medication as prescribed twice per day as needed. I was weak, fainted, wrecked my car, developed SVT heart problem then Sinus tachycardia! Wore a heart monitor for a month! Have to take a beta blocker twice a day for the rest of my life! Walmart offered me 4K for my troubles! I have a life of pills thanks to Walmart Pharmacy's neglect! I want the world to know what happened to me so it doesn't happen to anyone else!

I took this deadly combination of blood pressure medication for two months! When I called to fill my medication the third month, "Mrs. ** you don't have a muscle relaxer on file!" I said "I have the pill bottle right in front of me." I gave them the RX number on my pill bottle, I was placed on hold for what seemed an eternity! Then I was told to come to the pharmacy. They gave me the right medication and my copay for two months! </p>, <p>I refused the medication and took my business to Rite-Aid. They have been wonderful, they ask if you have any questions if you need to speak to the pharmacist. Very professional and caring! I love Rite-Aid! I was so sick for months and none of my doctors could tell me why, all my meds checked out on paper, but I was given a strong dose of blood pressure medication 1500 mg per day! I could have died! Please check your medications, you can look them up online to make sure the pills are the correct pills! Sorry Walmart 4K isn't enough to fix my car you caused me to wreck nor is it enough for me to take beta blockers twice per day for life! Walmart Pharmacy Holly Springs NC is not a good pharmacy! Please dont allow them to cause your death! Walmart doesnt care who they hurt or kill! I have filed a lawsuit! See you in court Walmart I still have my pill bottles too!</p>]
[<p><p>I picked up my third 90 Day Prescription since switching to Walmart last December. I ordered these refills last week knowing one would need physician approval and they still had a work day to contact him. I checked status Monday and the one had not been approved and I re-ordered. I was thinking I could pick them up when I went to town in a couple of days. I checked order status Monday and one was not refilled because they still needed to contact physician and I re-ordered again knowing it may be an issue with the 4th of July. </p></p>, <p>I picked up my third 90 Day Prescription since switching to Walmart last December.

They said it would be a couple more days yet. I explained I ordered this in plenty of time and should have had filled by now. Lady behind counter said she would double check when available and wanted to know if I was out. I told her not out yet and planned on not coming back for a while. She said she would check on it. A few minutes later she came back and said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I duly waited my 20 minutes and checked back. They had 2nd Rx ready and I picked it up. I commented that I was very unhappy that I had to wait for RX because they were supposedly out and I ordered the previous week. She replied it was late due to the holiday.</p>, <p>Well Walmart Pharmacy I think you need to invest in a calendar that notes weekends and Holidays. Last December when I placed my first order several days early and they were not ready due to being out and it was the holidays, In March of the this year I ordered 2nd batch of RX's and they were out and not ready due to weekend. Of course my third order today was late due to Holiday. On my way home from Kearney I located a small pharmacy only six miles from where I live and had them transfer all my RX's to them. Shame on you and your same day pharmacy service, especially when all 3 meds are very common prescriptions.</p>]
[<p><p>I've been using this pharmacy for about 2 years now and I have to say I'm more than pleased. I'm actually closer to another branch but I choose to go where people treat me right. I've been to other pharmacies where I'm treated like a junkie or a criminal meanwhile I'm a single dad who's just trying to do the best he can. The staff all know me. We can even joke around and they always help me if I have a question. They've even gone out of their way to find coupons for me because I don't have insurance. Now they don't have to do any of that it's not at all in their job description but they still do. I would recommend this branch to anyone needing to switch. Bravo to the entire staff.</p></p>, <p>I've been using this pharmacy for about 2 years now and I have to say I'm more than pleased.

[<p><p>I have my prescriptions filled by Wal-Mart in Taylor PA. I'm concerned about Pharmacists that work there. Pretty much on an every other month the pharmacists there DON'T read my notes and I end up driving back to get the order right. I am worried that they are going to mess up with an order because they do not read. They filled the order wrong again and I called Walmart and the person said I'm sorry. I said, "Can you please send someone here to pick up the mistake?" "No we don't have anyone for that." I was talking to someone else about this and they said this happens to a few people he knew. SO I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS A PROBLEM WITH THEM. Then if you call 1800 Wal-Mart they tell you they're busy call back later. They CARE.</p></p>, <p>I have my prescriptions filled by Wal-Mart in Taylor PA. I'm concerned about Pharmacists that work there.

[<p><p>I was near the pharmacy at the East Rome, GA Walmart, when a man walks up beside me and just walks off with my shopping cart. I wasn't even sure how to respond at first, but managed a meek "umm...hey... that's my cart..." Of course, I was ignored. I stated a little louder "Excuse me?" Again, nothing. He just kept on walking. Well, I'm not going to stand there and allow myself to be a victim, so I said loudly "Excuse me! That's my cart!" He finally stopped, and returned it. This wasn't a big deal, maybe it was just an accident... but either way, *he* was the one in the wrong, NOT me. </p></p>, <p>I was near the pharmacy at the East Rome, GA Walmart, when a man walks up beside me and just walks off with my shopping cart.

She made sarcastic remarks about me, stating "She didn't have to be so nice about it". So basically, I am being victimized by a Walmart employee for being the victim of an attempted cart theft. This is incredibly unprofessional behavior, and I do not appreciate being spoken about in this manner. I did not get the employee's name, but this event occurred on Sunday, at around 5:15 pm at the pharmacy inside the Walmart on Cartersville Hwy in Rome, GA. Neither me, nor my partner, will be returning to any Walmart location in the future.</p>]

[<p><p>My wife, who has been taking the same thyroid medication for years went to Walmart in Morgantown, PA to get her prescription. She was given the wrong pills. These generic pills have the same active ingredients as the pills she has been taking for the last 20 years, but the inactive ingredient are much higher in salt content which raises her blood pressure. The pharmacists was very rude insisting that the pills were the same. Having worked for the FDA and having checked with two other pharmacists, the FDA, and the Drug Manufacturer, I found out that I was right. And since we had gotten her prescription at this Walmart for about a year, I wanted to know why he couldn't fill it. He told us it was company policy and told me to call 1 800 Walmart to get the company's policy. </p></p>, <p>My wife, who has been taking the same thyroid medication for years went to Walmart in Morgantown, PA to get her prescription.

My assumption is that he does not have one. It is my understanding that as a Licensed Pharmacist in the state of PA he is required to give this information upon request. He continued to be rude and had my wife so upset that she was crying. I asked to speak to the manager and he replied they did not have one as he walked away from us. He then found that they had 55 of the 90 pills for her prescription but would not be getting any more in. </p>, <p>We have had many other problems with this Walmart: Employees smoking at the entrances and not the State's required distance away from the entrance. Employees being yelled at by supervisors and managers in front of customers. I watched a male manager yelling at a female employee to the point of making her cry. When I went to her aid I was told to mind my own business and the employee was told to get back to work. When I confronted the manager, I was told to get out of the store or he would call the police. I went outside and called the police but they couldn't do anything about it. I cannot believe that Walmart Corp. allows this kind of behavior and does not do something about this.</p>]
[<p><p>Walmart store #2482, Mesa Riverview Dobson Rd., Mesa AZ. I am reporting a pharmacy employee named **, and the pharmacist who was on duty and in charge at the time, **. First let me say that I have reported ** before to the store managers at least twice, and nothing gets done about him. He is consistently rude to me and my husband when we come in, and has a very cocky attitude.</p></p>, <p>Walmart store #2482, Mesa Riverview Dobson Rd., Mesa AZ. I am reporting a pharmacy employee named **, and the pharmacist who was on duty and in charge at the time, **. First let me say that I have reported ** before to the store managers at least twice, and nothing gets done about him. He is consistently rude to me and my husband when we come in, and has a very cocky attitude.</p>, <p>Tonight, 5/5/17 @ around 8 pm, I asked my husband to drop off my script for me. I am disabled with knee issues; my legs hurt so I waited in the car for him. We were on our cellphones to each other while he dropped the script off, so that I could hear how much it would cost. When my husband asked ** to give him the amount, he spoke to him very rudely. Now, we have no problem obeying rules, and completely understand the 'privacy issue', but what we DO have a problem with is, HOW WE ARE BEING ASKED TO DO SOMETHING. What ** SHOULD'VE said was, "Sir, I'm sorry, but I have to ask you to not be on your phone because of privacy issues, then I'd be happy to help you." But he didn't. What he said was, "You gotta get off your phone or I can't talk to you." My husband took the script and left.</p>, <p>I went in, alone, and asked ** at the register if HE could help me, and when he began, ** flew over by us and immediately started harassing me. He looked at me, started laughing and said to **, "She brought it back in!" I said, "Excuse me, brought it back in? And why are you laughing?" He said, "Your husband just came in here." That is when I said, "Yes I know, and you spoke to him very rudely." At that point ** yanked down a laminated sign that was hanging from the counter. He held it in front of my face, raised his voice and cockily said, "You see this sign! You see this sign!" He spoke to me in such a disrespectful manner, I went over to the register and saw that ** was standing in near proximity to the whole thing. He could hear how his employee was talking to me, and he most likely saw how he yanked the sign down and waved it in front of my face.</p>, <p>HE DID NOTHING TO DE-ESCALATE the problem, or to even HANDLE THE PROBLEM! He just let ** continue to speak to me that way. They both treated me terribly. I asked **, "Are you going to let him continue to speak to me that way?" He responded with, "Have someone else help you." He didn't even attempt to move from his spot at his computer. I told him that ** was helping me, and that ** had no business in any of this. I went back over to ** where ** continued laughing and talking crap about me under his breath to ** and another male employee that was there. I finally lost my cool and called ** a little jerk, which he seemed delightedly about, because he laughed even louder and continued to run his mouth about the sign. I again went over to seek **'s help, but again, he continued to do nothing.</p>, <p>An Assistant Manager, ** showed up and I explained the whole thing to him. Upon doing so, ** then loudly said to me, "HE (**) can't do anything to me, because he's not my boss and he's not with pharmacy." He continued talking and laughing looking at me and then whispering to **. I pointed out to ** his laughing; he blatantly saw it and did nothing, and said nothing to this employee. I asked him if he thought the laughing was right, in which he said no. I said that ** was instigating and that he should NOT BE WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC. He told me HE could do nothing because it was 'pharmacy'. WHO IS GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS EMPLOYEE? Don't you see that he is literally shaming the face of Walmart? Is THIS the kind of person you want representing your company? HOW IS THIS BEHAVIOR ETHICAL? Doesn't Walmart have a responsibility and obligation to treat its customers with respect?</p>, <p>Every time I come in when ** is there, he treats me rudely. He is sexist, and I would say ** is a sexist as well. I mean, would he have done nothing if ** did all this to a MAN? Or is ** just racist because I'm ** and he is not? I never see or hear him talk to other races in this manner? Or could it be that he is prejudice because I am disabled?</p>, <p>This guy has the attitude of a spoiled child that gets away with murder because his superiors are not disciplining his actions. Is it because he is not **, and they are afraid of stepping on his toes? Or is it because he is not ** AND on a work/education visa, or scholarship, that he is not being reprimanded? Whatever the case, he is this cocky and unafraid because he is being allowed to crap all over those who CHOOSE Walmart pharmacy to fill their medication needs. Everyone else in that pharmacy is wonderful, we are always treated very nice. ** is the only bad apple in the crew.</p>]
[<p><p>I am on several medications, and have been on some of them for many years. I had to get an exception for one, so I could get my full order of 90 tablets for a 30 day supply. This is one that if I miss a dose, I go through withdrawals. Well, when I got my refill the pharmacist called me, she said she didn't have the full amount. I needed some to get me through until their order came in, she said she can do that. I just called to tell them I would be there tomorrow to pick up the rest, only to be told I have to get a new prescription. She said, "When you accepted a lesser amount you're accepting as if that is what the doctor wrote for." Well, I was never told that, I would never have accepted that.</p></p>, <p>I am on several medications, and have been on some of them for many years.

[<p><p>Called in prescription, went to pick it up. They said somehow the phone did not pick it up. I asked if I could come back later that evening to get it and she said fine. When I can be back they only had 8 pills. I usually get 3 months at a time because I take care of a bedridden patient. So... A few days later I have to go back to get the rest of that prescription only to find out they have changed hours without telling me (or anyone). I guess they do not think prescriptions for people are all that important?? So I am going back for my 4th time tomorrow to get one prescription. They could care less about people. They have the worse pharmacy hours of anyone already and they have some nerve to cut another hour off their already horrible hours. I am saying bye to this irritating group of people who could care less about their customers... They are just too big and powerful to give a rip!</p></p>, <p>Called in prescription, went to pick it up. They said somehow the phone did not pick it up.

[<p><p>Very Rude Pharmacy Manager Derek. Wal-Mart Pharmacy did not have one of my prescriptions ready although they'd had plenty of time to fill. So I drove forty minutes back home then came back, stood in line 15 minutes and was told it still wasn't ready, told to come back in 20 minutes, returned again and told it still wasn't ready. Finally after sometime I was paged by the pharmacy manager, as I was walking up to rx desk I said, "It's a miracle!" The rx manager took offense to this and said "Do you want to take your business elsewhere?" I said, "I'll think about that." The rx manager said "Are you going to stop being condescending and treat us respectfully?" I then said, "Condescending? Respectfully?" He then tried his best at being sarcastic ie, explaining their meaning.</p></p>, <p>Very Rude Pharmacy Manager Derek.

He continued to push his rank trying to force me to give him respect? Respect is earned, which he obviously doesn't get. The younger generation think it is acceptable to be rude and hateful to their customers! What they don't care to understand is without customers they have no jobs!</p>]
