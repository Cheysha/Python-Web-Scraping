There isn't a day of down time unless you finish you work early or have a knack for the material. Prepare yourself for longchallenging tests and homework that isn't hard but can take awhile to do.

He knows we are not history majors and we could care less about the subject so he tells stories in a ""sum it up"" manor that makes it easy to follow. I never used the book, he always let us out early and he dropped 3 tests"
96142,5.0,2.0,ENGL1113,"Jul 6th, 2009", No,,,,,[],"He was always very clear when getting points across. The class can get on to some 'hot' topics, which is a lot of fun somtimes. Overall good class, but beware, stay on his good side..."

995733,4.0,3.0,PHIL1013,"Jun 2nd, 2014", Yes,,,,,[],"A great professor humorous and very lenient. The quizzes are VERY hard, open book, but that didn't even help. He did end up curving them though, because we all made such bad grades on them. other than the quizzes, the rest of his class is a breeze."
995733,3.5,3.0,PHIL1013,"Dec 18th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"Roberts is a really funny guy, he should be a comedian rather than a teacher. He is okay as a teacher, but things can go WAY off topic, which is okay but it wouldn't hurt for things to go on schedule. Other than that, you'll have a fun time in his class, there will be great laughs that's for sure. Also MAKE SURE YOU READ THE CHAPTERS!!VERY VITAL!!!"
713912,5.0,1.0,HST1213,"Mar 13th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"He was funny as hell, but still relayed a lot of important information. His class is really easy, but still leaves you equipped with the knowledge you neeed to succeed. Great teacher."

I never met him in person, but I felt like I knew him on a personal level. He always encouraged me and gave me suggestions on how to improve my writing. The class consists of 4 major essays. I think it also had somew"
995733,3.0,5.0,PHIL1013,"Feb 7th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"The teacher is fun and I enjoy being in the class. However, I don't feel I learned anything in the class to help me with the tests. The tests cover 200+ pages. The tests are open book but didn't find it to be much help. Appox 20-25 questions worth 100 pts..Finding the answer is like find a needle in a haystack."
995733,4.5,3.0,PHIL1013,"Oct 7th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"Pretty cool teacher, real funny. Taking his Intro to Philosophy course, and he is a pretty easy to understand teacher. One downside is that there is tons of textbook use, exams cover about 200+ pages, other then that he is pretty cool."

He always responded promptly to my emails (my class was on-line) and his encouraging words regarding my essays gave me a huge amount of confidence to continue writing from the heart. This professor is fantastic! Get him as your insstructor if possible!
995733,4.0,4.0,PHIL1013,"May 23rd, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"Philosophy online. Interesting class, challenging and pretty tough course though. I liked prof. Roberts but found it a little strange he used a fake student to run around harassing the real students. You will learn some good idealogy if you can just get past the weirdness.... which at the end of the day, I couldnt."
713912,4.5,3.0,HIST1493,"Jul 26th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"He is a great teacher, very helpful if you ask questions. You must not miss class and if you want an A you should read the chapters as well as take notes. His tests are from both the lecture and the book, read the questions carefully sometimes he throws curveballs. Extra credit is totally worth doing."

I was terrified of having to write four 8-page essays but Mr. Charlson lets you get by with essays of 400-500 words and I like that.

713912,5.0,2.0,HISTPOST,"Jan 16th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],He's a very nice guy. Class was boring but pretty easy. I made a B and didn't ever read. Just go to class and listen to the reviews he gives before the tests. He will even give answers and somehow people still miss the questions...i don't know why?.... I felt like he emphasized politics a little too much but overall a good class. I recommend him!

998071,1.0,3.0,PSY1113,"Oct 30th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"Amazingly useless. She gets a lot of her information wrong, she gives you power points of her notes for the test, which would make it easier except they don't have the information on the test.

He tells lots of personal stories about his job as a geochemist. He is rather lenient. He seems rather forgetful quite often and it can be a little frustrating, but I do like him.

Would take again for any subject.
535011,5.0,1.0,DEVPSYCH,"Dec 15th, 2004",,,,,,[],This was one of the easiest classes I have taken while in college. He gives you reviews before the tests then lets you use notes on the tests. He is a very nice and smart guy and makes class fun.

But that would only be if they took it out of perspective with the material being taught. And she challenges our own beliefs only by making us look at where they came from. Do not be scared off. She is great.
157401,5.0,4.0,COMM2213,"Apr 23rd, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],This is a very fun class! It was a little intimidating to go in front of the class and speak the first day but Gwin made it so easy. I recommend this class because she made it so much fun!

She is honest and that shocks some people. She shares her personal experience as it applies to the subject and tests the limits of her students. If you cannot hang - don't take. Otherwise she is a must.
