13337,2.0,4.0,HIST3290,"Mar 27th, 2018",,,,,,['TOUGH GRADER'],She does not like opinions contrary to her own. Dubious is a great way to describe her grading. I wish I hadnt taken her class.
13337,3.0,3.0,20231413,"Feb 23rd, 2013",,,,,,[],Dr. Lewis is the hottest thing about the history department.
13337,5.0,1.0,HIST3132,"Aug 20th, 2012",,,,,,[],She is very conversational and loves what she teaches.
13337,5.0,2.0,HIST4973,"Dec 21st, 2011",,,,,,[],"I had Dr. Lewis for my colloquium and capstone classes. She is sweet but sassy, and so very interesting. You can see that she enjoys what she does. I hold her in the highest regard. Honestly, if her classes can help you for graduation, take one. She made me a better writer, and I came to each class excited and ready to participate."
13337,4.5,2.0,HIST6200,"Mar 7th, 2010",,,,,,[],She was full of energy for this class. Very knowlegable and well orginized. Her papers are very easy to write and she grades fairly. Her exam essay was right to her lectures and reading assignments. She is flexable and understanding of issues that come up at the last minute. Willing to alter syllabus to fit the students she has in front of her
13337,4.5,4.0,HIST4973,"Oct 30th, 2008",,,,,,[],"I've had Dr. Lewis now for a total of three classes, and she is far and away my favorite history professor. Her classes are reading and writing intensive, regardless of level. If you are looking for a blowoff, go elsewhere. You will come out of her class a better history student and a better writer."
13337,5.0,2.0,HISTWS,"Jul 27th, 2005",,,,,,[],"This professor is really great. She's friendly, approachable, and very knowledgeable. She's also very entertaining if you can keep up with her sardonic wit. Here's a hint: make your papers relatable and entertaining to her! Good grader."
13337,3.5,2.0,HISTORY,"Jul 26th, 2005",,,,,,[],"J. Lew is great! Entertaining, knowledgable professor. Not too hard."
13337,1.0,3.0,HIST4973,"May 11th, 2005",,,,,,[],"Horrible teacher. VERY Biased if you do not agree with her views. She Can NOT grade worth a darn. Papers that would get an ""A"" in any other class will get a ""C"" in her class. She is also one of those types that no matter how much you write in an essay, to her, you ALWAYS left something out. AVOID!!!"
13337,3.0,3.0,EUROHIST,"Jul 11th, 2003",,,,,,[],"Smacks her lips. Knows a lot, interesting class, but dubious expectations and grades. Not approachable. Some reading assignments WAY to ambitious - e.g. 1600 pg books - and this is coming from an Engl. major."
13337,2.0,4.0,HIST3,"May 9th, 2003",,,,,,[],"at first, she seems OK but her grading, as someone noted, is 'dubious.' I (and many other people who've had her) had a problem with grading at the end of the semester, went to speak to her, and all she could say was, 'you write like an English major.'"
13337,5.0,2.0,HIST3290,"Dec 18th, 2002",,,,,,[],"Wonderful teacher, knows a lot about her subject. Very fun class."
13337,2.5,2.0,HIST,"Oct 7th, 2002",,,,,,[],She thinks she's teaching high school. I don't like her
13337,2.5,4.0,HIST,"Aug 22nd, 2001",,,,,,[],"a very smart person, but is hard to decipher and grades w/dubious methods."
13339,1.0,5.0,LSTD3133,"May 3rd, 2023",,,,,,"['TOUGH GRADER', 'PARTICIPATION MATTERS', 'LOTS OF HOMEWORK']","Trust me when I say this, he is literally the worst professor I have ever met. Gives no feedback and just doesn't seem to care at all or wants to see you succeed. I would do everything in your power to NOT take his class!"
13339,1.0,5.0,LSTD3133,"Oct 12th, 2022",,,,,,"['TOUGH GRADER', 'GET READY TO READ', 'LOTS OF HOMEWORK']",Do. Not. Take. I promise you. Hardest grader and worst professor
13339,1.0,4.0,LSTD3133,"Sep 28th, 2022",,,,,,"['TOUGH GRADER', 'GET READY TO READ', 'LOTS OF HOMEWORK']",Hardest grader for no reason. Grades all of the papers so hard and gives little to no good feedback. He doesn't even teach or provide lessons but expects everybody to know exactly what he wants on their assignments. Good luck getting an A in the class. Would not take him if you have the choice.
13339,2.0,4.0,LSTD3133,"May 9th, 2022",,,,,,"['TOUGH GRADER', 'PARTICIPATION MATTERS']",Let me just say that this class was so extremely difficult for no reason... Gross grades the assignments so tough. I took the other humanities class last semester and ended with a 99. This semester I barely have a B. He critiques more on writing and organization than the content which is lame. He grades so tough on every single assignment beware!
13339,1.0,5.0,LSTD3133,"Mar 5th, 2022",,,,,,"['TOUGH GRADER', 'GET READY TO READ']",He is IMPOSSIBLE to work with. He expects everyone to be adaptive to his way of teaching which is unlike anything iâ€™ve ever experienced and subject to change whenever he wants. He communicates through10 paragraphs announcements that have new additional requirements for assignments.he is incapable of holding himself accountable and blames students
13339,2.0,3.0,LSTD3133,"Oct 10th, 2018",,,,,,['TOUGH GRADER'],"quizzes and discussions were easy. On essays he seemed to focus way more on writing errors than content. The essay grades were very inconsistent. He doesn't give much feedback other than ""good content but writing errors"" but there is no rubric to see how he grades. I found myself running out of things to write about based on the prompts he gave."
13339,3.0,3.0,LSTD3133,"May 14th, 2018",,,,,,"['GET READY TO READ', 'PARTICIPATION MATTERS']","Professor Gross gives minimal feedback on all assignments and fails to warn you that all the reading you will do goes largely unnoticed. You will read the entire textbook in the 8 or 16-week course, and you only answer questions on a few pieces of it. The last unit was almost 200 pages to be read in a week and a half."
13339,1.0,4.0,LSTD3133,"May 14th, 2018",,,,,,[],Do not take him!! Assignments arent hard but he is not a fair grader on the essays!!
13339,1.0,4.0,LSTD3133,"May 14th, 2018",,,,,,['TOUGH GRADER'],"Dont recommend him. Assignments arent necessarily hard but hes a tough an unfair grader. Dont take this class unless youre an English major and know everything about humanities of the modern world, because he will find many writing errors. Grading is pretty inconsistent. Would never take another class with him."
13339,5.0,2.0,LSTD3133,"May 24th, 2017",,,,,,"['GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK', 'CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA']",Interesting material and the easiest grader I've ever had.
13339,5.0,3.0,LSTD3133,"May 1st, 2017",,,,,,"['CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA', 'CARING']","I took the online section of this course and it was great. There were 4 essays, 4 quizzes, and 4 discussions. Each went with a unit and they were due every 2 weeks (it was only an 8 week course). He was very helpful and understanding when I needed to turn a paper in late. I would definetely take this class again. Easy way to get this credit over w/"
13339,4.0,3.0,ENGL2313,"Jul 9th, 2016",,,,,,[],Excellent class that i never wanted to miss. Took two courses with him.
13339,2.5,4.0,LSTD5013,"Dec 14th, 2014",,,,,,[],"Confusing assignments, pared with his vauge grading requirements made this a pretty difficult class. He did not say until after the fact what he was looking for in assignments, and it made getting a good grade really difficult. He is not good at explaining what his expectations are and grades very strictly on grammar and style."
13339,1.5,5.0,LSTD3133,"Sep 20th, 2012",,,,,,[],I was really excited about this class because my first humanities class was interesting. This guy is awful. Doesn't seem like he wants to help at all. I've NEVER made anything less than a B in any class. I received a C-. His grading is unclear an when you ask for help he won't give it. Teachers are supposed to help. He wouldn't at all.
13339,5.0,3.0,LSTD5013,"Nov 13th, 2010",,,,,,[],I took an online class with him. At first I hated the readings but after doing the papers I think they were a good selection. I loved this class.
13339,5.0,2.0,ENGLALL,"Jun 10th, 2008",,,,,,[],"Dr. Gross rocked my world when I was at OU. He made us read Germinal in World Lit and it changed everything for me. It truly is a ""doggy dog world."""
13339,3.5,1.0,LOTS,"Jul 26th, 2005",,,,,,['LOTS'],Attendance: Mandatory
13339,5.0,1.0,ALL,"Mar 26th, 2005",,,,,,[],Dr. Gross was my inroduction to the OU English department and raised the bar as far as my expectations of what a college professor should be like. He's one of the best profs I ever had at OU.
13339,4.5,3.0,ANY,"Feb 3rd, 2005",,,,,,[],"His retirement leaves a hole in the Department. His convoluted teaching style used to frustrate me, but I find myself teaching as he did. A worthy human being and sorely missed, now more than ever . . ."
13339,5.0,3.0,ENG,"May 6th, 2004",,,,,,['ENG'],"You were right, Dr. Gross. Capitalism does indeed suck."
13339,4.5,2.0,ENGL4423,"Feb 27th, 2004",,,,,,[],"Dr. Gross Rocks! He is sooooo in love with literature and it is very very infectious. He is a great lecturer. And he is very funny and very cool. lots of reading though! lots! pretty leftist, but i didn't mind."
13339,4.5,2.0,ENGL2313,"Oct 30th, 2003",,,,,,[],"Dr. Gross is a great teacher. Everyone taking English classes ought to have him at some point or another. He is a fairly difficult grader, but you get so much more out of him than simply literature."
13339,5.0,3.0,VARIOUS,"Jul 15th, 2003",,,,,,[],I always liked this guy. Even when he called me a bourgeois ****! It's a long story. Witty and fair despite political differences. Question: Does he still talk about mind forged manacles?
13339,3.5,2.0,CAPSTONE,"Jul 11th, 2003",,,,,,['CAPSTONE'],"Dr. Gross loves his job and his subject. He allows a lot of independent thought and work. His lectures are barely organized and I felt like I didn't get as much out of the books b/c of this. Frustrating, but fun."
13339,4.0,2.0,ENGL3000,"Apr 26th, 2003",,,,,,[],"he is still in love with what he teaches! liberal and witty and not didactic. this class was a good experience, but kind of chaotic at times."
13339,5.0,3.0,ENGL,"Oct 10th, 2002",,,,,,[],Professor Gross's passion for literature is inspiring and infectuous!
13339,5.0,3.0,ENGL,"Aug 22nd, 2001",,,,,,[],"easily distracted, a digressive lecturer; brilliant and funny if you're patient."
