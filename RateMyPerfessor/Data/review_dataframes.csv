1698079,3.5,2.0,1113,"Dec 7th, 2014", Yes, Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],Do the readings and take notes in class and you'll do well. The tests are straight forward from his power point notes. There was an extra credit paper offered too. I believe there was a 10% participation grade so if you're extra shy probably not the class for you because there's discussions over the readings every so often
13337,2.0,4.0,HIST3290,"Mar 27th, 2018", Yes, Mandatory, B+, No, Yes,['TOUGH GRADER'],She does not like opinions contrary to her own. Dubious is a great way to describe her grading. I wish I hadnt taken her class.
13337,3.0,3.0,20231413,"Feb 23rd, 2013", Yes,,,, Yes,[],Dr. Lewis is the hottest thing about the history department.
13337,5.0,1.0,HIST3132,"Aug 20th, 2012", Yes,,,, Yes,[],She is very conversational and loves what she teaches.
13337,5.0,2.0,HIST4973,"Dec 21st, 2011", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"I had Dr. Lewis for my colloquium and capstone classes. She is sweet but sassy, and so very interesting. You can see that she enjoys what she does. I hold her in the highest regard. Honestly, if her classes can help you for graduation, take one. She made me a better writer, and I came to each class excited and ready to participate."
13337,4.5,2.0,HIST6200,"Mar 7th, 2010", Yes,,,, Yes,[],She was full of energy for this class. Very knowlegable and well orginized. Her papers are very easy to write and she grades fairly. Her exam essay was right to her lectures and reading assignments. She is flexable and understanding of issues that come up at the last minute. Willing to alter syllabus to fit the students she has in front of her
13337,4.5,4.0,HIST4973,"Oct 30th, 2008", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"I've had Dr. Lewis now for a total of three classes, and she is far and away my favorite history professor. Her classes are reading and writing intensive, regardless of level. If you are looking for a blowoff, go elsewhere. You will come out of her class a better history student and a better writer."
13337,5.0,2.0,HISTWS,"Jul 27th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"This professor is really great. She's friendly, approachable, and very knowledgeable. She's also very entertaining if you can keep up with her sardonic wit. Here's a hint: make your papers relatable and entertaining to her! Good grader."
13337,3.5,2.0,HISTORY,"Jul 26th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"J. Lew is great! Entertaining, knowledgable professor. Not too hard."
13337,1.0,3.0,HIST4973,"May 11th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"Horrible teacher. VERY Biased if you do not agree with her views. She Can NOT grade worth a darn. Papers that would get an ""A"" in any other class will get a ""C"" in her class. She is also one of those types that no matter how much you write in an essay, to her, you ALWAYS left something out. AVOID!!!"
13337,3.0,3.0,EUROHIST,"Jul 11th, 2003",,,,, Yes,[],"Smacks her lips. Knows a lot, interesting class, but dubious expectations and grades. Not approachable. Some reading assignments WAY to ambitious - e.g. 1600 pg books - and this is coming from an Engl. major."
13337,2.0,4.0,HIST3,"May 9th, 2003",,,,, Yes,[],"at first, she seems OK but her grading, as someone noted, is 'dubious.' I (and many other people who've had her) had a problem with grading at the end of the semester, went to speak to her, and all she could say was, 'you write like an English major.'"
13337,5.0,2.0,HIST3290,"Dec 18th, 2002",,,,, Yes,[],"Wonderful teacher, knows a lot about her subject. Very fun class."
13337,2.5,2.0,HIST,"Oct 7th, 2002",,,,, Yes,[],She thinks she's teaching high school. I don't like her
13337,2.5,4.0,HIST,"Aug 22nd, 2001",, Mandatory,,, Yes,[],"a very smart person, but is hard to decipher and grades w/dubious methods."
1700779,1.0,5.0,PSY2503,"Jun 28th, 2020", No, Mandatory,, No, Yes,['GRADED BY FEW THINGS'],No instructions are listed for the essays and the syllabus barely states anything. Probably one of the worst classes ive taken. Poor organization and communication from the professor. If you do bad on one project you are set up to make nothing more than a C.
1700779,4.0,2.0,PSY2503,"Jun 14th, 2020", Yes, Not Mandatory, B+, Yes, Yes,"['RESPECTED', 'INSPIRATIONAL', 'CARING']",A genuinely nice man who knows what hes teaching. I appreciate the effort he put into us helping understand the class and material. He grades things fairly easy. Would recommend to anyone!
1700779,3.0,4.0,PSY2503,"May 5th, 2017", Yes, Mandatory, B+, Yes, Yes,"[""SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS."", 'TEST HEAVY', 'GRADED BY FEW THINGS']",SOO much harder than you'd think it is going to be. Lecture is only once a week and the tests are extremely difficult

Terrible with technology. Occasional quizzes but usually warns you. A lot of reading but it is English. You learn a lot. A few take home tests that are essays, then one term paper for the final. He is very understanding and is overall amazing. Would take again. TERRIBLE handwriting but he tries his best."
488922,2.0,1.0,ENGL2433,"Nov 15th, 2017", Yes, Mandatory, A-, No, Yes,"['GET READY TO READ', 'PARTICIPATION MATTERS', 'LECTURE HEAVY']","He obviously knows what he is talking about, and is clearly passionate about literature. Although he is incredibly unorganized and there is little discussion, he pretty much just rambles for an hour and a half. Not only that but he gets off topic frequently and goes on tangents that have little to do with what we are supposed to be talking about."
488922,4.5,2.0,ENGL1113,"Nov 4th, 2015", No, Mandatory, A+,, Yes,[],"Dr. Carter is a fantastic professor! He has terrible handwriting, he is inspirational, and he enjoys teaching so much that he continues to teach even though he is retired. If you are a good writer, this class is incredibly easy. I felt like Dr. Carter got to know me on a personal level, and I would highly recommend this class!"
488922,4.5,2.0,2133,"Oct 22nd, 2014", Yes, Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],Professor Carter is such a great professor! He really does get into what he is teaching and talking about. He is also pretty laid back and easy. He gives you time on assignments and the work and readings aren't too hard!
488922,4.5,3.0,ENGL2243,"Jun 29th, 2012", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"Carter was an awesome professor. I got a little lost in the class every now and then, but he showed great understanding for that and helped us along. Great grading system for papers- really willing to work with you on EVERYTHING, this includes absences. I thoroughly enjoyed his class."
488922,5.0,3.0,ENG3163,"Mar 27th, 2012", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"This is a great class to take with a great professor. The readings were interesting. No tests, just 2 major papers and some minor writing assignments. The only class I've ever had where all the students participated in the discussions willingly. If you fail this class it's because you tried really hard to."
488922,5.0,2.0,ENGL2313,"Jan 19th, 2012", Yes,,,, Yes,[],Chris Carter is a great professor. He is extremely attentive and helpful while still challenging the individual. The class could easily be boring if the interest isn't in the individual but Carter presents the material very well and challenges critical collegiate thinking very effectively. Not to mention he is an outstanding guy and super nice.
488922,5.0,4.0,ENGL2313,"Nov 15th, 2011", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"Carter is amazing. He is so sweet and just a great guy. He is understanding of many situations. Some of the works we read were not my favorite, but some were very good. There are no tests, just essays and in class writings randomly. As long as you read and write well, you will do well. Participation is also encouraged, but isn't hard to do."
488922,4.5,3.0,ENGL2313,"Aug 21st, 2010", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"He is an outstanding professor that appreciates the student voice in his classes. He tries to stimulate different view points, but he doesn't promote his own. The revision process allows any grade to improve. He is extremely helpful through e-mail and outside of class as well. This was a great class that was taught by a great professor."
488922,5.0,3.0,ENGLGRAD,"Dec 2nd, 2006", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"Outstanding instructor! Flexible, friendly, respectful of student voices, extremely knowledgeable. The kind of teacher I want to be when I grow up. Class discussions were full of cross-talk. Readings were challenging yet manageable. Comments on student writing were both generous and insightful."
488922,5.0,4.0,WRTGRHETLIT,"Oct 3rd, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"I hate this class. It was supposed to be a writing class but the focus isn't on doing any writing, it's on analyzing the different styles of writing. The handouts were painful, boring, and dry. I love the professor though, he's a great guy, fun and interesting, and you can get away with not reading the papers. ;) He's a great guy, horrible subject."
488922,3.0,3.0,LITANDRHET,"Sep 15th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"Not a compelling course, the guy is somebody I would have a good conversation with at a coffee house, but the course was pretty lame (dry and tedious were good words from earlier ratings). The papers were WAY too much on crap i didn't care about, but that's English for you. At least you could get away with not doing the reading..."
488922,4.5,3.0,ENGL3143,"Jun 3rd, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"this is the nicest guy ever! a real sweetheart of a guy. i HATED his class, but can't say enough about the quality of his character. the problem is that the rhetoric class i signed up for turned out to be literacy & technology. learned nothing about rhetoric, did well despite. take any class you can get with him! carter is worth it!"
488922,5.0,4.0,ENGL3143,"May 29th, 2005",, Mandatory, B,, Yes,[],"Dr. Carter has designed a class that is interesting and relevant. I actually learned something by working on the papers he assigned and he devotes a lot of emphasis to the writing process. Great course, wonderful teacher."
488922,4.5,3.0,ENGL3143,"Mar 30th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"Dr. Carter is a wonderful professor. Some of the readings in this class were VERY dry, but he is responsive to the opinions of the students and very fair in the grading and revision process."
488922,3.5,2.0,ENGL3143,"Nov 6th, 2004",, Mandatory,,, Yes,[],"Lectures and reading assignments had very little to do with writing projects. Fair professor and is responsive to students, but the class is just tedious."
1674124,5.0,1.0,ANTH4223,"Jan 31st, 2022", No, Not Mandatory, A+, Yes, Yes,"['INSPIRATIONAL', 'GRADED BY FEW THINGS', 'AMAZING LECTURES']","Amazing prof. He knows its a gen ed class and that there are a lot of people in there just for the UD elective credit so he makes it very easy. 3 essays with 1000-1500 words and a final. Reading are very interesting as well as the discussions in class, but not mandatory. He is SO smart, caring, and woke. I would give him a million stars if I could."
1245398,2.0,4.0,PSC1113,"Jul 25th, 2017", Yes,, B-, No, Yes,"['TOUGH GRADER', 'GET READY TO READ', 'LOTS OF HOMEWORK']",This class is required by all majors and should not be this difficult. The online quizzes are not bad but they do take a long time and there is one basically everyday. The exams are hard. And the essays are graded hard. Also discussion posts at least once a week. Too much work for a gen ed.
1245398,3.5,3.0,PSC1113,"Apr 16th, 2015", Yes,, A+,, Yes,[],"Took this class over winter break. Because of that we were expected to read almost entire textbook in 3 weeks - I found that a bit difficult. Sondra Petty also likes to talk about themes that are almost non-relevant to the stuff that we are reading about in our books. But if you do your assignments and readings, you will get a good grade!"
1674124,5.0,4.0,ANTH4223,"Dec 23rd, 2021", No, Mandatory,, Yes, Yes,"['GET READY TO READ', ""SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS."", 'PARTICIPATION MATTERS']","Spicer is a wonderful professor. Just have the will to learn from his readings and discuss it during class with the questions he gives out. If you dont have the the diligence to be in class, then that will hurt your grade. He takes notice on who wants to be there. He will be happy to answer any questions you have."
1245398,4.5,4.0,1113,"Jan 21st, 2015", Yes, Not Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],"I took this class during winter and I would recommend that for EVERYONE! We met for only two weeks. The lectures were hard sometimes because the class lasted so long, but she allowed us frequent breaks and was pretty engaging. She gives handouts for the exams and they are open booknote. As long as you hold onto the handouts you'll ace the tests!"
1674124,4.5,1.0,ANTH1823,"Dec 22nd, 2015", Yes, Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],His class is interesting and an easy A. As long as you read all the readings and go to class you will do fine. He is extremely easy going and sometimes funny. He gives you a study guide before every test and goes over it in detail.
1245398,4.5,2.0,PSC1113,"Sep 30th, 2009", Yes,,,, Yes,[],Professor Petty was a GREAT professor! She was always willing to help with office hours to answer questions in class. Her lectures sometimes were a little tough to stay awake in but she overall was great! The final consisted of questions from the previous tests and she gave a review that had EVERYTHING you needed to know on it:) GREAT TEACHER!
1674124,4.5,1.0,ANTH1823,"Dec 20th, 2015", Yes, Mandatory, A+,, Yes,[],"Class is interesting for the most part but the lectures can get kind of boring. Spicer is really passionate about the subject and wants all of his students to understand the topics and do well in the class, which is really nice."
1245398,1.0,4.0,PSC1113,"May 15th, 2009", No,,,, Yes,[],"Horrible. She lectures over nothing relevant and teaches nothing from the book. Then, the tests are essentially made up crap having to do with neither of the aforementioned sources. It was bad enough we are required to take PolSci 1113, she just made it worse."
1674124,4.0,2.0,ANTH1823,"Nov 20th, 2015", Yes, Not Mandatory,,, Yes,[],"Easy A. Very passionate about what he teaches. Readings are required, but gives a study guide before each test."
1674124,4.0,2.0,ANTH2613,"Oct 6th, 2014", Yes, Not Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],"Fairly easy professor and class, but loved every moment of it. The reading is certainly required, but he makes it worth your while. He's very interesting to listen to, knows a ton about Native Americans and anthropology in general. Great professor!"
13339,1.0,5.0,LSTD3133,"May 3rd, 2023", Yes, Not Mandatory, C,, Yes,"['TOUGH GRADER', 'PARTICIPATION MATTERS', 'LOTS OF HOMEWORK']","Trust me when I say this, he is literally the worst professor I have ever met. Gives no feedback and just doesn't seem to care at all or wants to see you succeed. I would do everything in your power to NOT take his class!"
13339,1.0,5.0,LSTD3133,"Oct 12th, 2022", Yes, Mandatory,,, Yes,"['TOUGH GRADER', 'GET READY TO READ', 'LOTS OF HOMEWORK']",Do. Not. Take. I promise you. Hardest grader and worst professor
491097,4.0,4.0,FR4153,"Dec 13th, 2015", Yes, Not Mandatory,,, Yes,[],"Excellent class, excellent professor. The reading is essential, though most of the assigned texts can be found online for free. Grading is fair and reasonable. Generous with extensions, attendance is not strictly enforced, and you don't HAVE to participate in class. Student discussion was limited, but he's open to answering questions in lecture."
491097,3.5,2.0,MLL4173,"Dec 5th, 2007", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"A very amusing, interesting prof. Assignments are somewhat vague, though, so grading can seem arbitrary. Readings not extremely interesting, so discussion can get pretty boring. I would take the class more for the prof than the content."
491097,4.5,1.0,MLLL4173,"Sep 10th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"He was really pleasant to work with. Fun, nice, and interested in the subject and talking with students. Always available. Mostly easy assignments, fair grading. I recommend Winston for any class you want to take with him."
491097,5.0,2.0,FR3423,"Jan 19th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],I had him for Advanced French Comp. He was very personable and was just a really fun prof to have. I would definitely reccomend him for whatever class he is teaching
491097,4.0,1.0,MLLL4173,"Nov 8th, 2004",,,,, Yes,[],"Funny, engaging, even silly at times. Very good way to get an upper-division non-Western Civ credit, unless you just hate French and everything to do with it."
1710494,3.0,3.0,MKT3323,"Apr 4th, 2020", Yes, Not Mandatory,, Yes, Yes,"['GRADED BY FEW THINGS', 'TEST HEAVY', 'GROUP PROJECTS']",He's so sweet and really struggles with technology but he really does try hard and cares about his students. His lectures are detailed and well written. Guidelines for the group project is very clear and wasn't not hard at all. Class is basically graded on test though which were semi challenging. Final is optional which is nice.
1248050,5.0,3.0,SWK3103,"Nov 14th, 2020", Yes, Mandatory, A+, Yes, Yes,"['INSPIRATIONAL', 'GRADED BY FEW THINGS', 'AMAZING LECTURES']",Dr. Wells has truly inspired me to the workings of William Miller . The spirit of Motivational interviewing is something I will strive to follow as a future social worker. Professor Wells is a master in his field. His patience and understanding has played a role in my personal and professional growth.
1248050,5.0,2.0,SWK3003,"May 6th, 2019", No, Mandatory, A+, Yes, Yes,"['GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK', 'RESPECTED', 'GRADED BY FEW THINGS']","Kind, honest and direct in how you can improve. Its afraid to help with anything he can, overall amazing man!"

He is an amazing teacher and he makes his classes very easy. I had him for intro and interviewing and would definitely take him again. Easy A and my interviewing skills have greatly improved. Don't buy any books, you won't use them."
1248050,4.5,1.0,3003,"Dec 12th, 2014", Yes, Mandatory,,, Yes,[],"He is a really great professor and the class is more interactive rather than lecture. But he is really bad about responding to emails or handing back grades, which can be irritating."
1248050,4.0,2.0,3003,"Nov 6th, 2014", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"Dr. Wells has a lot of wisdom to give his students. He cares about the success of the student. He rarely lectures. As a result, class time is very interactive. He made my interviewing class fun. I was thoroughly impressed by him. I would definitely take him again!"
1248050,1.5,4.0,GENERALPRACTIC,"Mar 29th, 2013", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"Professor would ignore emails without responding. There was a disconnect in class because he would assign work prior to teaching the material, then ""grade easy"" as a reward. Then on the final paper he graded completely different than he had on all previous papers. He didn't submit final grades to the school until three days after they were due."
1248050,4.5,2.0,SWKALL,"Feb 15th, 2012", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"He is so knowledgable about the subject he teaches and he is passionate about social work. Amazing and caring professor, and he will communicate with you regarding your work through e-mail and phone - he actually responds!! If you want an interesting class with an intelligent professor...take him"
1248050,5.0,2.0,SWK101,"Aug 5th, 2010", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"He is an excellent teacher. I really had very little interest in social work, but after taking one of his classes as a non-major, I am now attending grad school for social work. Very helpful and passionate about what he is teaching!"
493216,2.0,3.0,ASTR1514,"Feb 15th, 2015", Yes, Not Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],"She seems like a nice enough professor, and a genius, but is difficult to understand. You aren't required to go to classes or buy the book, but if you don't, you probably won't pass. The only assignments are through labs (which will be your saving grace). Tests are extremely difficult, but she does drop one. She gives extra credit abundantly."
1248050,5.0,1.0,SWK3003,"Nov 23rd, 2009", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"He is awesome. If it wans't for him, I wouldn't be in Social Work."
493216,2.0,4.0,ASTR1504,"Dec 11th, 2014", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"Dr. Wang is a nice person but doesn't know how to teach the material very well. She is exceptionally intelligent; however, she does not teach in the most efficient or helpful way. I had to study a lot for the tests, and, more times than not, had to guess on a good portion of the tests. She does give bonus sometimes for attendance."
493216,1.0,4.0,1514,"Nov 12th, 2014", Yes, Not Mandatory,,, Yes,[],"Hated every second. Most frustrating class I have ever taken. She is probably a nice person, but is an absolutely awful professor. Do not take Astronomy with her."

I study very hard, and still fail the tests. She is unclear, her tests do not correlate to what you learn in class, unless you're an expert on remember that thing she said ONE time. Very frustrating."

Homework is short, and tests aren't too bad. His website has previous exams with solutions to help you study for test. If he teaches a class and take a different professor, you will be missing out."
487324,2.0,5.0,MATH2423,"Apr 20th, 2012", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"hard subject, tests are ridiculously hard. even he thinks he makes it too hard sometimes. exam score averages are really low. however, he curves the class. a C is from 55-69, so it is possible to do well. good TAs are necessary. homework due every friday, so the book is essential. attendance mandatory only one day a month that you know in advance."

487324,5.0,1.0,MATH2443,"May 22nd, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],Good professor. Tests match homework problems. Take him for any calculus or differential equations.
487324,4.0,2.0,MATH3113,"Jan 5th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"Very knowledgable and will always help you. He's a pretty nice guy, though he seems very shy. Best advice is to go to class and take notes. If you take notes, do the homework and study his old tests, you should be able to ace his tests"
