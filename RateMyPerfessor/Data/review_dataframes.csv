13337,2.0,4.0,HIST3290,"Mar 27th, 2018", Yes, Mandatory, B+, No, Yes,['TOUGH GRADER'],She does not like opinions contrary to her own. Dubious is a great way to describe her grading. I wish I hadnt taken her class.
13337,3.0,3.0,20231413,"Feb 23rd, 2013", Yes,,,, Yes,[],Dr. Lewis is the hottest thing about the history department.
13337,5.0,1.0,HIST3132,"Aug 20th, 2012", Yes,,,, Yes,[],She is very conversational and loves what she teaches.
13337,5.0,2.0,HIST4973,"Dec 21st, 2011", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"I had Dr. Lewis for my colloquium and capstone classes. She is sweet but sassy, and so very interesting. You can see that she enjoys what she does. I hold her in the highest regard. Honestly, if her classes can help you for graduation, take one. She made me a better writer, and I came to each class excited and ready to participate."
13337,4.5,2.0,HIST6200,"Mar 7th, 2010", Yes,,,, Yes,[],She was full of energy for this class. Very knowlegable and well orginized. Her papers are very easy to write and she grades fairly. Her exam essay was right to her lectures and reading assignments. She is flexable and understanding of issues that come up at the last minute. Willing to alter syllabus to fit the students she has in front of her
13337,4.5,4.0,HIST4973,"Oct 30th, 2008", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"I've had Dr. Lewis now for a total of three classes, and she is far and away my favorite history professor. Her classes are reading and writing intensive, regardless of level. If you are looking for a blowoff, go elsewhere. You will come out of her class a better history student and a better writer."
13337,5.0,2.0,HISTWS,"Jul 27th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"This professor is really great. She's friendly, approachable, and very knowledgeable. She's also very entertaining if you can keep up with her sardonic wit. Here's a hint: make your papers relatable and entertaining to her! Good grader."
13337,3.5,2.0,HISTORY,"Jul 26th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"J. Lew is great! Entertaining, knowledgable professor. Not too hard."
13337,1.0,3.0,HIST4973,"May 11th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"Horrible teacher. VERY Biased if you do not agree with her views. She Can NOT grade worth a darn. Papers that would get an ""A"" in any other class will get a ""C"" in her class. She is also one of those types that no matter how much you write in an essay, to her, you ALWAYS left something out. AVOID!!!"
13337,3.0,3.0,EUROHIST,"Jul 11th, 2003",,,,, Yes,[],"Smacks her lips. Knows a lot, interesting class, but dubious expectations and grades. Not approachable. Some reading assignments WAY to ambitious - e.g. 1600 pg books - and this is coming from an Engl. major."
13337,2.0,4.0,HIST3,"May 9th, 2003",,,,, Yes,[],"at first, she seems OK but her grading, as someone noted, is 'dubious.' I (and many other people who've had her) had a problem with grading at the end of the semester, went to speak to her, and all she could say was, 'you write like an English major.'"
13337,5.0,2.0,HIST3290,"Dec 18th, 2002",,,,, Yes,[],"Wonderful teacher, knows a lot about her subject. Very fun class."
13337,2.5,2.0,HIST,"Oct 7th, 2002",,,,, Yes,[],She thinks she's teaching high school. I don't like her

67557,5.0,3.0,350,"Nov 6th, 2014", No,,,, Yes,[],"Being a freshman, I was nervous taking Prof. Sawaya's Unlikable Women's course, but she made me feel very comfortable immediately. She is so intelligent, and her interpretations of text are really amazing to listen to. She by no means is intimidating or pretentious, and I can say her class was my favorite so far at William and Mary! Love her!"
67557,4.0,4.0,ENG2773,"Dec 14th, 2011", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"I really loved Dr. Sawaya's class! She's sweet, smart, friendly and knows what she's talking about. The course is highly interesting and the texts she chooses are all fascinating. Yes, there is lots of reading and quite a few papers but if you love English; no problem. She does have high expectations but is willing to help everyone individually."
67557,4.0,3.0,ENG4713,"Jul 28th, 2010", No,,,, Yes,[],"Lots of reading, but not more then a lot of classes. You read at home then discuss in class. As long as you talk in class and pay attention you will do well. She is very understanding and works with you if you need it. Just do the reading, talk, and she gives you three possible choices and pics two for her tests. Prepare ahead and you're good"
67557,4.5,3.0,ENGL2883,"Dec 7th, 2006", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"She is clever and, if you give her the time, there is a lot you can take from her classes and from meeting her during office hours. She puts a high standard on you, and expects you to live up to it."
67557,4.5,3.0,HON2973,"Sep 7th, 2005",, Mandatory, Rather_Not_Say,, Yes,[],"she is so sweet and very very helpful. i found her class to be very interesting. don't let the sweetness trick you though, she is tough when she grades papers. go to her for any advice... just go outside of class period."
67557,4.5,3.0,FEMINISTTHEORY,"Apr 24th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"Class discussions are very interesting, be prepared to read a TON, but she is super sweet, helpful, and kind. Really enjoys teaching and students."
67557,3.0,4.0,ENGLISH,"Jan 15th, 2005",, Mandatory, Not_Sure_Yet,, Yes,[],"Very, very smart. Knows her stuff. Very kind to students. BUT -- do not take her class without a background in literature. Assumes you have that background and grades accordingly."

67563,5.0,4.0,ENGL3653,"May 6th, 2016", Yes, Mandatory,,, Yes,[],Dr Velie is a wise and brilliant professor who deftly navigates through the Bible as literature with a strong grip on the theological issues as well. He enjoys the course material & the participation of the students. The textbook by a Bart Ehrman was problematic. Mr Ehrman seems to have little or no respect for the Bible and its message.
67563,4.5,5.0,ENGL3653,"Oct 11th, 2012", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"Had him for Bible as Lit and had to drop the class because I just couldn't get the information down. However, I loved his lectures and really enjoyed listening to him speak. Harris book is interesting, definitely should have used it more! Hard class, would recommend if you want to really, really challenge yourself."
67563,5.0,4.0,ENGL001,"Jan 20th, 2010", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"Simply the best professor I ever had at OU. He scared the wits out of me, but I learned how to think, how to write, and how to teach from him. No one has ever had a more profound effect on me. Highly recommended."
67563,3.0,3.0,ENGL3653,"Jan 4th, 2010", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"I took him for Bible as Lit. He's definitely an old school lecture only professor - and he's awesome. Blue book tests can be interesting because there are so few questions and so much material covered, but his grading seems fair. Don't particularly need to read the Bible, but you do need to read the Harris book. Recommend the class overall."
67563,5.0,4.0,ENGL4003,"Sep 22nd, 2009", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"the sweetest taste of literature I ever had, and the only prof in the place worth my time, money, and thought...if I could, I'd have taken him for every class because he knows everything I ever wanted to know."

67563,5.0,3.0,CLASSSECT,"Aug 22nd, 2007", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"Dr. Velie is your quintessential old-school professor. If you're tired of classes with no meat on their bones, Velie is the antidote. Ever have a class that's all discussion and no learning? Ever get tired of hearing more from other students than from your professor? Take Velie's class. Every day you'll walk out smarter than when you walked in."
97262,5.0,4.0,JMC4323,"Nov 28th, 2016", Yes, Mandatory,, Yes, Yes,"['HE IS JUST AMAZING WITH FULL OF CREATIVITIES', 'GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK', 'LOTS OF HOMEWORK', 'GROUP PROJECTS']",HE IS JUST AMAZING WITH FULL OF CREATIVITIES
67563,5.0,3.0,ENGL,"May 17th, 2006",,,,, Yes,[],"Alan Rockmore Velie: Intelligent, charismatic, intimidating but never dare miss class--you'll miss something great. All-around great guy; he's fun in class, fun at rugby, and really supportive if you're smart enough to make him notice you. Beware: He does not suffer fools gladly. Read your assignments and proofread your papers."
67563,5.0,4.0,ENGL,"May 14th, 2006",,,,, Yes,[],"I took several classes with Dr. Velie, and learned more from him than from all of his departmental colleagues combined. Professors of his intellectual caliber are rare. Rather than stagnate in one field of study, he explores new subjects constantly. He inspired me in every sense of the word. I feel honored to have been among his students."
97262,3.0,5.0,43434323,"Feb 5th, 2015", Yes, Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],"Avery is one of the best professors. He seems like a scary guy, but he's willing to help if you ask. Avery is one of the smartest in the business, but don't be afraid to argue with him every once in a while. If you're into conferencediscussion style learning you'll walk away from his class learning everything you need to succeed in advertising."
67563,4.5,2.0,CAPSTONE,"May 7th, 2006",,,,, Yes,[],"great class, great professor. Velie is interesting and funny. this class gave a new challenge to the literature we have all studied ad nauseam."
97262,3.5,4.0,3303,"Jan 7th, 2015", Yes, Mandatory, B,, Yes,[],"Avery is one of those rare teachers who really cares about what his students accomplish post graduation. If you want to do something great in advertising, engage with him and learn from him. One of my best professors at OU."
67563,4.0,3.0,BIBLEASLIT,"Apr 26th, 2006",,,,, Yes,[],"He gets you thinking and teaches you more than the Bible. Most effective class I have taken at OU. Learned more than any other class and the course work was not hard, it was not a heavy load, especially if you have grown up in Sunday School!"
97262,3.5,4.0,JMC3300,"May 14th, 2009", Yes,,,, Yes,[],Extensive knowledge in subject matter and high grade of applicable work experience. Any degree of animosity is relative to professors's lack of ability to adequately convey message and passion in teaching.

97262,1.0,5.0,JMC4343,"Apr 27th, 2008", No,,,, Yes,[],"He gives horrible direction. And if you go to his office hours, all he will do is give more work. Worst, most time consuming class I have ever taken. I don't understand how students can like him. He is an egomaniac."
67563,4.0,4.0,ENG4434,"Sep 11th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"Dr. Velie is a challenging professor, and why are you in college if you don't want to be challenged at some point? Witty and demanding, you will leave his class with stronger writing skills and an appreciation for analysis."
97262,3.0,4.0,ADVACCTPLA,"Oct 5th, 2005",, Mandatory, B,, Yes,[],"Awesome teacher, but not easy. I feel I have learned more in his class than most other teachers put togethre."
67563,5.0,4.0,ENGL,"May 5th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"Finest professor I ever had, and totally hot. Brilliant man--witty and interested in everything. If you're an idiot, don't take a class with him--he'll rip you to shreds, and you'll DESERVE it!!! But if you want to learn how to read, think, and write at your very best, this man will show you how."
97262,2.5,4.0,ADCAPSTONE,"Sep 1st, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],His instructions were poor. He wanted us to be able to read his mind.
67563,2.0,4.0,BIBLEASLIT,"Mar 29th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"I found him to be very repetitive and boring. Also very oppinionated, and this class was more like a history class than a literature class. I was excited to take this course, but then very dissapointed."
97262,1.5,3.0,INTADVERTISING,"Aug 29th, 2005",,,,, Yes,[],"Very unorganized and very unhelpful. His class is easy if you can figure out what you're supposed to be doing. Knows his stuff, but doesn't know how to relate it to the class."

97262,4.5,5.0,JMC4323,"Aug 13th, 2004",,,,, Yes,[],"I thought that he was a great teacher. He can be very blunt and sarcastic, but he doesn't waste your time. He is SO experienced and witty...he can just come across kind of mean at times"

97262,5.0,3.0,INTRO,"Dec 17th, 2003",,,,, Yes,[],"All those who made bad comments, obviously can't cut it in the ad world. Avery is a great professor and you'll learn more in his classes than any other. He's a professional who knows the business and teaches from experience."
97262,5.0,2.0,INTLADV,"Dec 17th, 2003",,,,, Yes,[],"Everyone should get the chance to take this class. You get a glimpse of what it's really like in an overseas ad agency. You don't just work hard, but you play hard too. Avery gives you plenty of free time to do what you want to sight see and shop."
97262,2.5,4.0,JMC4923,"Dec 14th, 2003",,,,, Yes,[],He is the type of teacher that pushes you to learn through experiencing what it is like to be in an agency. You might not realize how much you have really learned until the end of the semester.
97262,3.5,3.0,ACCTPLAN,"Dec 11th, 2003",,,,, Yes,[],"The man knows his stuff. Nothing is sugar coated, just like real jobs. This class felt like a biz meet more than class.

Only gripe is tendency to read dense power point slides aloud. Otherwise, no spoon-feeding. Very little lecturing. Review sessions are very helpful for the final. Final is fair. The class is as engaging as you make it!"

He is at his best in seminars, but when he has to lecture a lot, it gets really boring, really quickly. I've heard most of the stories three times, and he adapts the stories to the class.

You walk out feeling like you have real knowledge of art- IF YOU GO TO CLASS AND PAY ATTENTION. This is not a blow off class. You have to study and you but it is so worth it.

To the guy below who misspelled ""wasteful,"" go back to high scool. I mean school. Dr. Kamoche's classes are difficult, but if you do the required work, you actually learn a lot, and when you earn an ""A"" in his class you know you really deserve it, which is why I thought we were in college.

All the material comes from just him talking, and he talks way too fast and just rambles for you to be able to take very good notes at all. And at the end of the class there's a 15 page minimum paper due that counts for 1/3 of your grade which he grades VERY harshly! Plus the class itself is just extremely boring."

She can be a bit intimidating in the beginning, but her bluntness is just a part of her personality and if you embrace it, you'll actually find she's pretty funny and amiable; rambles, but she encourages interjections to remedy this; Work load for an Intro. course is VERY doable and she's loose about grades anyway. I give her an A!"
67544,3.5,1.0,ENGL2213,"Dec 8th, 2011", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"The class was dull in and of itself, but easy. Every class consists of a discussion over the reading material. There were 2 papers and 2 tests. If you are a half decent writer and want an easy class to fulfill the arts requirement, take it."
