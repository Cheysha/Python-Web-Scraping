248633,1.0,4.0,MUSI3783,"Jan 1st, 2013", No,,,,,[],Boring. He goes on and on but really never tells you what to do or how to approach an assignment. Not a helpful class to say the least.
728607,2.5,3.0,INDIVIDUAL,"Mar 22nd, 2015", No, Mandatory, A-,, Yes,[],Has a lot of cue cards and the criteria is a little unclear tests were not to bad and the class was fun overall
248633,3.0,4.0,MUSI3783,"Dec 7th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"Adams is ok. Very friendly, but too busy for teaching."
728607,3.0,3.0,MANY,"Nov 8th, 2013", No,,,,,[],Love her as a person. She strays from the syllabus almost completely. Notice for tests and homework are given a class or two beforehand. Tests are fairly simple.
248633,4.5,1.0,MUSICI,"Sep 4th, 2005",,,,,,[],he was so cool & nice to me!
728607,3.5,3.0,MOTOR,"Jun 24th, 2013", Yes,,,,,[],Great teacher and person. Tests are pretty difficult but she makes sure they're over the information you cover on the slides and nothing else.
248633,4.0,4.0,MUSICTHEORY3,"Aug 30th, 2005",,,,,,[],"Aug 30th, 2005"
492839,5.0,2.0,MKTG3616,"Dec 21st, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],Great teacher! Since he's young he's not too far removed from being a student himself. Tries to make dry info as interesting as possible. Take him if you can!
248633,4.5,4.0,THEORY,"Sep 11th, 2003",,,,,,[],"Sep 11th, 2003"
492839,5.0,3.0,SPORTSMKTG,"Nov 27th, 2005",,,,,,[],"Cumiskey's class is awesome. The class is incredibly easy as it applies the same marketing principles you've learned previously in a sports context. If you're not a moron and have even a mild interest in sports you'll make a ""A""."
492839,5.0,3.0,3433,"Nov 9th, 2004",,,,,,[],"Kevin is an excellent, young teacher. I would recommend this class to anyone. He gives extra credit often and is willing to help students so much. He shows funny videos in class. Makes class fun and entertaing for all. Not too mention his test reviews are a great help!"
731457,5.0,1.0,GEOL1114,"May 25th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"I'm not even a Geology major, but she made this class super fun and interesting! She's really funny and helpful. I actually enjoyed coming to her class. Just take notes and ask questions if you need to, and you'll be fine for the exams!"
731457,5.0,1.0,GEOL1114,"Mar 23rd, 2012", No,,,,,[],Easy A if you take her for intro to Geology. She gives lots of bonus points and tests are straight from the lectures. She has a good sense of humor and is lighthearted. Make sure you do good in lab and on tests and you'll get an A.
250159,5.0,5.0,ART4101,"Apr 29th, 2011", No,,,,,[],"Best instructor ever! Be prepared to work, work, work. If you do, and you listen and take criticism, the world is yours. Carey will prepare you for anything. Although her classes are 3 hrs/day 2/wk if you come prepared and show initiative you can usually be let go to work on your own. She will allow you to succeed on your own if you can."
731457,5.0,1.0,GEOL1014,"Mar 21st, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"This class went by in a blur. Never once studied (just read) and got a 98. A lot of the content is common sense. Types of rocks, water cycle and other things that are generally simple. No math required. You'll need excel. Overall, a very simple class. Cruse was funny and intelligent. The TA's were surprisingly friendly and smart. Good class to take"
250159,5.0,3.0,ART2403,"Dec 16th, 2010", No,,,,,[],"Very helpful as long as you ask, deadlines are expected to be met or the class can ""fire"" you as an illustrator. Expect to work outside of class & have good technique, learn a lot by end of class. Usually doesn't make you stay all class period except for critiques, good effort = good grade."
731457,5.0,2.0,GEOL1014,"Sep 2nd, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"She's incredibly smart and funny. She loves Geology and succeeds in passing that to the students. I was deathly afraid of Geology cause i suck at science, but if you read and listen at lectures youll do fine. She's also extremely kind and helpful. Labs however with the TA's are boring, complicated, and awkward. If only Dr. Cruse taught those too!"
250159,5.0,1.0,ART3403,"Dec 12th, 2010", No,,,,,[],"Such an amazing professor. She really knows who is going to make it and who isn't in the real world. Also, gives great advise on how to showcase your portfolio. I would recommend her to anyone."
731457,4.5,2.0,GEOL1014,"Jun 6th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"TAKE THIS CLASS! The material wasn't the easiest, but she gives out bonus points left and right! I had so many bonus points from the tests, showing up on rainy days, etc that I didn't have to do the Excel project and I still ended the semester with a 105 average. I would totally recommend taking this class With that being said, be prepared for lab!"
250159,4.5,4.0,STUDIART,"Nov 6th, 2010", No,,,,,[],"She brought the 'high-end'-ness to what design is rather than coming off as a typical ""can't cut it in the real-world' type of stigma a professor can get in this industry."
731457,5.0,2.0,GEOG221,"Apr 19th, 2010", No,,,,,[],favorite college professor yet! hilarious
250159,5.0,3.0,ILLISTRATIONS,"Aug 30th, 2005",,,,,,[],"Aug 30th, 2005"
731457,5.0,1.0,GEOL1014,"Dec 3rd, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"I loved Dr. Cruse! I didn't think I'd like Geology at all but she made it really interesting. She's funny, lively, and really good at analogies. She's also very prompt with grading and organized. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT! It's easy and worth your time (she offers a ton). You'd be wise to take this class if you need a lab credit; it's fun and easy!"
250159,3.5,2.0,ART3403,"Sep 16th, 2003",,,,,,[],"She teaches all levels of Illustration. On the lower level courses she is pretty easy on students just as long as they get their work done by deadlines. On the upper level, she is a bit more demanding of high quality work, which in the end is a good thing"
731457,5.0,2.0,GEO1014,"Oct 14th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"She is very animated, funny and passionate. She gives a lot of extra credit and she lets you make your own study guides. Light studying is best for tests, because her tests cover a lot of material. The tests are not hard and easy to understand. The labs can kind of be ridiculous but everyone gets an A on the labs. Amazing professor."
731457,4.5,4.0,GEOL1114,"May 6th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"Lecture is boring, but attendance isn't mandatory. Test reviews are little more than a list of the chapter headings. Tests are tough, but you can get 9 EC points per test (just do it, it's worth it). Make sure you go to lab- it really bails you out. The field trip is terrible, but you've got no choice."
731457,3.0,4.0,GEOL1114,"Mar 24th, 2008", No,,,,,[],"tests are hard, even if you study. the extra credit helps but the test questions are random."
731457,5.0,2.0,GEOL1014,"Dec 16th, 2006", No,,,,,[],"Great Professor! She is lively and entertaining in lecture! She's really helpful.I didnâ€™t think I would like geology but she made it fun, I really enjoyed it. I never once opened my book. I had a great lab T.A. Her tests are based off her PowerPoint slides. Extra Credit was given for all tests including the Final. I would definitely recommend her!"
731457,4.0,3.0,GEOLOGY1014,"Nov 29th, 2005",,,,,,[],"The class is based off the slides lectures, i never opened my book. She is really intrested in the subject so she tries to be lively with examples, but if you still find the subject a bore, it easy to want to fall asleep. The lab is hard depending on the TA, she gives extra credit options with about every test, and the tests are too bad."
731457,3.5,4.0,GEO1114,"Oct 19th, 2005",,,,,,[],"The class was a straight lecture from Powerpoint slides. Dr. Cruse was willing to help. The lab is pretty difficult, depending on which T.A. you get. The class can be hard, read a lot before each test."
252401,4.5,4.0,FREN1115,"Dec 29th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"She is hard but for a reason: she makes you LEARN A LOT. She intimidated most of the class, but if you just ask questions, she answers clearly! Her accent is thick, but be patient because she really tries her best! Attendance is important to her, and to you keeping up with her helpful lectures. I learned SO much in one semester. Be brave &TAKE HER."
252401,5.0,3.0,FREN2232,"Dec 14th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],LOVE this woman. Made every story we read very interesting. 30% of the grade is coming to class. She makes it fun. She was slightly intimidating at first because she is a native french woman but i learned alot and i can't wait to take another one of her classes. i definitely understand french better after taking her class.
252401,3.5,2.0,FREN1115,"Dec 9th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"She is pretty easy to follow, does do a question and answer style for learning. It probably helps to have a good grasp of grammar."
252401,4.5,4.0,FREN2233,"Jul 6th, 2011", No,,,,,[],"I absolutely loved this class. It was definitely difficult material but she made it so simple to understand. Granted, if you missed a day, you fell so far behind in the material because she hardly uses the book. I learned so much in this class and her French accent is better for learning than an American accent!"
733246,4.0,4.0,ART1303,"Feb 14th, 2016", No,,,, Yes,[],"Dave Roberts is probably the most level-headed and easy to get along with instructor at OSU. No touchy ego to deal with, just clear cut rules, expectations, and help, from a seasoned artist and instructor. If you screw up and get a bad grade in his class, it's on YOU!"
252401,2.5,4.0,FREN1115,"Nov 7th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"Class is hard. Compared to other teachers, she makes the class ten times as hard then it should be. If you can learn a language by just having it said to you and then repeating it, take the class. Tests were what got me, harder then other teachers, made you memorize a french blog, definatly save ur gpa and stress level, DO NOT TAKE!!! not worth it!"
733246,5.0,3.0,ART1303,"Mar 22nd, 2006",,,,,,[],"One of the best professors I've had at OSU. He is very understanding, laid-back, and just plain nice. He does ask a lot from his students, but would you learn any other way?"
252401,4.5,2.0,FRENCHLIT,"Apr 11th, 2005",,,,,,[],"This woman makes even the dullest french novels seem interesting and exciting. Class is not easy but not too hard, just read before you come to class, she does pick on you to speak, but her teaching style makes you learn. Loved the course. Name is David Schmunk- Spring 05"
252401,5.0,4.0,FREN,"May 8th, 2004",,,,,,[],"Everyone's comments are spot on. She's a great lady, hilarious, and she makes you learn. It amazes me the disparity between the other french profs, and her and Howland. You HAVE to take one of these 2."
252401,4.0,4.0,FREN4183,"Apr 30th, 2004",,,,,,[],"Absolute doll! Actually had her sister send us cakes from Paris so that we could understand the taste that she described. Like everyone else said, she's hard and doesn't like slackers, but if you put out an effort, she'll help you as much as she can."
252401,4.0,3.0,FREN3222,"Apr 24th, 2004",,,,,,[],"She's the second of the great French profs at OSU (there's only two, the rest are awful). She takes a genuine interest in her students and is always willing to help. She doesn't take kindly to slackers though."
733260,5.0,3.0,BIOC4113,"Jul 26th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],This is a tough class but I learned more in this class than any other. This class REALLY prepared me for medical school. I definately recommend Dr. A and this class.
733260,5.0,3.0,BIOC1990,"Nov 16th, 2009", No,,,,,[],"Nov 16th, 2009"
733260,5.0,2.0,BIOC3653,"Jul 7th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],An awesome professor. They don't get better than Prof Ayoubi!
733260,5.0,3.0,BIOC3653,"May 2nd, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],Great Professor
733260,4.0,3.0,BIOC3653,"Nov 21st, 2005",,,,,,[],"Very Knowlegable. Covers a lot of material - gotta study! Lectures are a bit boring (powerpoint) but good, informative and cover what's on the exam. Very well organized."
493409,3.0,4.0,MATH4023,"Jan 4th, 2023", N/A, Mandatory, A+, Yes, Yes,[],He is generally good but as apathetic as other Oklahoma professors. I worked hard and got A in all the courses despite that he refused to give me a recommendation letter.

The class is broken up to just quizes and exams. I averaged 50-60% on quizes and that was with some study at the MLSC, he grades very strictly. If you do the homework and understand each problem the exam is a breeze, I 100%-ed two and one of them I got a 140%. He gives hints on whats on the exam."

742183,2.0,4.0,CALC1114,"Jan 9th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"Very poor quality in terms of an overall review of this teacher. Has trouble communicating simple ideas in english, and stutters often. I had taken calc previously, but you better be prepared to get outside help or teach yourself if its your first time. Luckily because the entire class nearly failed the tests, she curved the final grade quite a bit"
493409,2.5,5.0,MATH2233,"Aug 15th, 2015", Yes, Mandatory,,, Yes,[],"Dr. Ullrich is very clear about what he expects from you in the class. IF YOU DO NOT SHOW UP, YOU WILL NOT PASS. All of his examples, which often re-appear in some form on the exams, are the only way to understand his specific rules for grading. There is no mandatory homework, but if you do not work the problems out of the book, you will fail."
742183,1.5,2.0,MATH2163,"Jun 29th, 2010", No,,,,,[],"Kinda hard to understand. Do the reviews because the test is very very similar. Not that bad if you keep up with the homework and do the reviews. However, I had to do a lot of teaching myself some concepts"
493409,3.0,4.0,MATH2233,"Jan 12th, 2015", Yes, Not Mandatory,,, Yes,[],Condescending. Constantly belittling students. Very rarely gives partial credit. Mumbles commentary to himself under his breath.
742183,2.5,3.0,MATH1613,"Dec 8th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"Go the the MLRC and you'll find it's much easier than how she teaches homework. Do the reviews for tests because their almost identical to the test. Attend class because class attendence replaces your lowest test grade, even your final if it is the lowest one."
493409,4.0,4.0,2233,"Dec 8th, 2014", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"He teaches like so; First day you learn the material and he assigns the homework. The next class day he reviews any homework questions you have. Then the next class will be a quiz unless he feels like more time is needed. Partial credit is very ""special case"" scenario. Other than that, he's a great at teaching the subject. Sometimes rude."
742183,1.0,4.0,CALC1,"Dec 12th, 2007", No,,,,,[],She is difficult to understand. Gives waaay too much homework and let's all face the fact that MapleTA is horrible itself. But she doesn't know how to answer questions and provide help. If it's possible...avoid this one.
493409,3.0,4.0,MATH2233,"Nov 19th, 2014", Yes,,,, Yes,[],This is a class that most people either get an A or an F in. If you go to every class and DO THE HOMEWORK it's by far the easiest differential equations class at OSU.
742183,1.0,5.0,MATH001,"Oct 25th, 2007", No,,,,,[],She is hard to understand and gives examples that do not correspond to the Homework assignments. Don't waste your money on this class.

493409,4.0,2.0,MATH2233,"Nov 5th, 2014", Yes, Not Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],"Probably the easiest math class ever, did the homework (homework is not required but is a must if you want a good grade), walked through examples for full class periods in between new material and gave direct steps on how to do them, ask questions from homework and work all the homework assigned and you'll easily sail through the class"
742183,1.0,5.0,MATH2123,"Dec 19th, 2005",,,,,,[],"WORST TEACHER EVER! she can't speak english and cannot teach worth anything. stay away if at all possible. class average was a D. ya, really."
493409,1.0,5.0,MATH2233,"Dec 12th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],This is the worst professor I have ever had. He constantly brings down students and tells them how awful they are. He grades extremely quickly and does not give any partial credit. Avoid at all costs.
742183,1.0,5.0,CALC2123,"Nov 3rd, 2005",,,,,,[],"She tries, but often gets confused by simple questions and has to correct her own mistakes quite frequently (nobody's perfect, but this gets ridiculous). She has a hard time explaining the material (besides the fact her english isn't very good) and assigns a lot of homework over a short period of time. Goodluck if you take this class with her."
493409,1.5,4.0,MATH2233,"Nov 29th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"This professor is absolutely the worst teacher I have ever had. He hardly ever gives partial credit, which makes his class significantly harder than other sections. He is also rude, mean, and will bash students for answering questions wrong in class. He often goes on rants on how awful the students are. He seems to hate answering questions too."
493409,1.0,5.0,MATH2144,"Apr 14th, 2011", No,,,,,[],"Horrible teacher. He's smart, and thats it, he's not good at helping anybody but himself. Do not waste your time or money with him if your taking calculus."
493409,2.0,5.0,CACL2100,"Dec 1st, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"I did not prefer his style of teaching. And even when I was withdrawing from his class my adviser was like ""oh you were in HIS class."" Because there were so many complaints of how he taught. Don't take his class!"
493409,3.0,5.0,CALC2144,"Nov 1st, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],He is a very intelligent professor but he emphasizes the need to understand Calculus instead of just getting answers right. Test are extremely hard so work a lot of extra problems and web assign isn't fun.
493409,2.5,3.0,MATH2233,"Apr 28th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"He's good, but he's harsh and has a bad attitude. I got an average of 98 just before the final exam and I still got a B because I made a little mistake in the finals coz I wasn't feeling too good, every other things in the final were great except for one question, and he still gave me a B"
493409,2.0,5.0,MATH2233,"Aug 12th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"Absolutely no partial credit. Chain smokes black and mild cigars, and he smells like them. Scares students into not asking for help. Yells frequently. Extremely hard class because there are only about 4-6 questions on each test and if you mess up 1 little thing you get a C, you mess up 2 little things and you get an F. And I do mean LITTLE things"
493409,4.5,3.0,MATH2233,"Jan 7th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],He is a nice guy and has a good sense of humor. He is also very good at covering the material. The biggest point though is he rewards hardly any partial credit. So make sure that all of your calculus is flawless before going to take an exam.

This is the worst course I have ever taken, it is just plain hard and if you do not have your calc concepts crystal clear, you will be in for a surprise.

Hard class, but well worth it."

But I assume you are at college to learn!"

Tests are long, reading is plentiful."

Really good teacher!
515551,1.0,4.0,ACCT2203,"May 10th, 2016", Yes, Not Mandatory, C,, Yes,[],"Nabar doesn't really teach. He just goes over the practice problems from the book but if you read the textbook you should have no problem passing the class.

I highly discourage taking his course."
282631,1.0,5.0,BIOL1114,"Dec 16th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],Rikin is very hard to understand and doesn't review the material. He has a very thick accent and by the time you understand what he's trying to say he's moved on to a new topic. Avoid taking him at all costs. Take French if you can.

He may not be the best teacher in the Biology department, but Biology is just a hard subject in general. If you attend clas, pay attention, and do well in lab (which is 40% of your grade in that class), you will do fine."

I took him for Leadership Dynamics, thinking it would be a blow-off, but it ended up being extremely challenging. He is a great teacher if you are looking to learn. Definitely a worthwhile class,but don't expect a free A."
515744,5.0,2.0,RUSS2225,"Mar 23rd, 2006",,,,,,[],"Dr. Tribble is an excellent professor. He is almost too easy, I think. He lets us get away with knowing less than we should. He may be a little forgetful at times, but he is on top of things and has a lot of spirit, if he lets it show. Tests and weekly vocabulary aren't tough, but do study for them."
282631,1.0,5.0,BIOL1114,"Dec 29th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],I can't understand a thing he says. When I would ask him questions he either couldn't hear me or wouldn't understand my question. Very irritating.

515744,4.5,3.0,RUSSIANDII,"Jan 18th, 2005",,,,,,[],"By far the better of the Russian teachers. Dmitri cannot relate to students the way that Tribble does. Regardless of how hard his tests are, his main purpose is in your learning. In Russian I, I should have probably failed, but because I worked in the class I received a B. He really cares about you!"

515744,2.0,2.0,RUS,"Nov 30th, 2004",,,,,,[],"I took the first year of russian with Dr. T and he is not clear, not a good lecturer, and not helpful. Although it has nothing to do with his teaching, he frequently entered the class with his fly down, and it would remain so the entire class."
282631,3.5,3.0,BIO1114,"Feb 25th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],He is a good guy and tries to be funny in class. Sometimes he is hard to understand but sit towards the front and you won't have any trouble. Make sure you read the book and take a lot of practice tests. It really helps!

282631,3.0,2.0,BOT3263,"Jan 10th, 2010", No,,,,,[],"I took his Plants and People class and found that it is extremely boring but bring a crossword, it passes the time. The tests were easy and so was the 12 page paper. His only fault is being too pretentious and sometimes embarrasing students. Study his old exams and it's an easy B!"
755425,4.0,2.0,MGMT3013,"May 12th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"Very nice instructor. This was an online 8 week course, taught by Eastman and Pappas. Would definitely recommend this class. They had the lectures all on podcasts, so with an i-Pod, it was nice. Would recommend notecards for studying for the tests, helped with the definitions. Online study guide helped a lot, also."
282631,2.0,4.0,BIOL1114,"Jan 3rd, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],Class is somewhat hard but this professor makes it alot harder because he doesnt go over everything necessary for the tests. For all of the tests I learned most of the material on my own because there are many practice tests that the biology department puts online. Professor is also very hard to understand
755425,1.0,5.0,MGMT3013,"Jan 11th, 2009", No,,,,,[],Fall semester 08 from what I understood was Mr. Eastman's first time to teach undergrad students. It was appearent that he did not take the transition in mind and kept the exams at a grad student level. The Exams were completely different from what was told to study.

Studying old exams are great because he recycles questions! He has a dry sense of humor but is very easy to talk to! He does have an accent but he is easy to understand unless you focus on his accent."
282631,2.0,5.0,BOT3263,"May 8th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"Riken was the worst prof I've ever had. This class gave me my FIRST C in college -in my streak of A's & B's. His teaching style is reading off notes & adding onto it with random facts. Be prepared for the 14-pg term paper. If you don't know ANYTHING about plants, dont take this class. He expects you to know every single detail in exams."
282631,3.0,4.0,BOT3263,"Dec 10th, 2008", No,,,,,[],"The only way you wouldn't be able to understand him is if you have never left the state of Oklahoma. Still, boring lectures and tons of information to remember. Not really a fun class, but attendance is not mandatory. The online tests are mislabeled, so be careful.

He did have an accent, but it wasn't so bad that I couldn't understand him. Make sure and do your best on labs, study with the practice tests, and attend class to get the in-class points. If you do that it's pretty easy to get a B and with a little extra effort an A."

You never know what's going to be on his test"
282631,1.5,5.0,BIOL1113,"Jun 19th, 2008", No,,,,,[],He was not a good teacher whatsoever. The class is difficult so get a teacher that can help and explain things well. He is hard to understand.

282631,2.5,2.0,BIOL1114,"Oct 25th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"Sit up front so you can hear him as his accent can be difficult. Go to class for the activity points, do well in lab. Make sure you look at the required readings (check the website for a list). Do the old practice exams, they really help. Likes to embarrass anyone who falls asleep (they deserve it though). Rehashes everything 3 or 4 times. A bit rude, seems to dislike teaching."

282631,1.5,4.0,BIOL1114,"Jun 21st, 2007", No,,,,,[],he might be a nice guy but he shouldn't be teaching... he really does just cover the powerpoints and must expect you to go over all of them on your own time at the rate he goes... and his accent (however nice or pleasent it may be) makes it difficult to understand and he isn't capable of expressing what he means clearly
282631,4.0,3.0,BIOL1114,"Jan 7th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"Rikin's English is more advanced than that of the complainers on this site. His class was challenging, but stimulating as well.

Make sure to attend both class and lab bc it's required as a part grade. Only bad thing is that self-tutuoring is needed & tests count for a large part of your grade.

Also curves and gives extra credit."

The class can be difficult since she does fly through the material, but she'll stop class to help if someone has a question. Don't fall asleep, she'll point you out to everyone. She has a custom book that you must buy, so you don't actually have to buy the text book. Random attendance checks."
916702,4.5,4.0,ACCT2213,"Aug 6th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],Dr. Don is amazing. This is by far the most challenging class I have taken at OSU but I learned the most.

140464,1.0,5.0,STAT2103,"Dec 19th, 2010", No,,,,,[],Horrible class. Always yells at people for no reason. You can't concentrate because you are afraid she will yell at you randomly. She does attendance checks when less people show up. The tests are all written. Very hard tests. Homework is almost random and does not help for tests.

Most importantly...NO CELL PHONES!"

He included interesting facts into his lessons and told everything like a story. He plays music everyday before class which also makes the class fun because he talks about it as well. Grading in this class is solely based on your tests grades.
140464,5.0,4.0,STAT2011,"Feb 5th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],She is an excellent teacher. Difficult subject. You can tell that teacher is extremely important to her. She really tries hard to make sure you are learning. She will help you endlessly and she is also pretty cool to go talk to about other things.
561219,5.0,1.0,GEOG1113,"Nov 15th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],Puts a lot of effort into his lectures. Makes the class interesting and fun to go to. The tests are very easy if you just study the review it is almost verbaitum. Attendance isnt mandatory but he gives you extra credit if you do.

Lectures aren't the best, but occasionally he'll say something useful. Pros: He has podcasts of each lecture, plus podcasts where he works out old tests and old homework assignments. Before old tests, he has review sessions that are usually pretty helpful."
201361,3.5,3.0,CHEM1515,"Apr 16th, 2011", No,,,,,[],"He is extremely nice, but his tests are really difficult. Even if you do all of his work and the labs, they still don't really help clarify what is on the test. He DOESN'T curve test, so what you get is what you get. You don't have to attend class, but it helps to attend class."
201361,1.0,5.0,CHEM1515,"Apr 6th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"This class is my worst class in college thus far, despite this class being the one I put the most effort into. Gelder grades his tests super harshly, so if you want an A in this class and have not taken AP Chem in high school and passed the AP exam, I suggest you take a different chem. He does not curve exam scores."
201361,4.5,2.0,CHEM1314,"Mar 29th, 2011", No,,,,,[],"He is a reasonable guy. His class is curved 15% for his grades (85 gets you an ""A"" and so on down the line).

I would have taken fewer classes w/ it. However, he has a lot of resources online such as podcasts & reviews. Also, every time I have emailed him, he ALWAYS replies & is helpful! TIME will be the issue!"
201361,1.5,5.0,CHEM1314,"Nov 11th, 2010", No,,,,,[],"I am an honors student & I must admit that this is the worst professor I have ever had. His tests are ridiculous & his grading is even worse. If he put nearly as much time on the student's needs as he does his ""online system""(which is completely disorganized, useless & time consuming) there would be a higher success rate for the students, I'm sure."
201361,4.0,3.0,CHEM1314,"Nov 8th, 2010", No,,,,,[],He is very knowledgeable about the subject but sometimes gets hard to follow. Go to class and do the homework and you will do good. Homework is a large part of the grade so even if you don't Ace the tests you will be ok. Learn where the TA's room is and get help from them often on homework assignments.
201361,5.0,3.0,CHEM1515,"Jun 22nd, 2010", No,,,,,[],"Dr. Gelder has a quirky teaching style and personality. Once you understand what he expects you to know on tests however, the class becomes less stressful. He's always willing to explain a concept again, but there is work involved, just like any science class. I personally hated Chemistry before I entered his class, but now it's my favorite subject"
201361,2.0,5.0,CHEM1515,"May 6th, 2010", No,,,,,[],"I had Gelder for 1314 and 1515. If I had to do it over I probably would have looked into the other teacher. He assigns 13 problem sets during the course and they take FOREVER to complete. His tests are beyond annoying because the material is not hard, but the amount of time given is way too short to complete them with A quality work."
201361,1.0,5.0,CHEM1515,"Apr 12th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],Gelder is very obnoxious and arrogant!! He thinks he is funny when in reality he is not. His class is almost impossible to follow. His tests are ridiculously hard and the amount of homework given is excessive. Do not take a lot of other classes with this one you will regret it! I was not able to find help outside of class to pass this class.
201361,1.5,4.0,CHEM1314,"Dec 15th, 2009", No,,,,,[],This guy was way too into his hobby of html coding and webpage creation.

I had a family emergency and had to miss a test and he was very willing to provide a make up exam. Video lectures are a little outdated though, and quite long for a 3hr class, but informative. Love that they are available in podcasts!"

He is a great guy and likes to get off track during lectures which can actually keep your attention if you are on the 1 hr. 15 minute tuesday/thursday schedule. I made a A so you can too

But in the end he"
243964,3.5,3.0,ECON2103,"Oct 27th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],I recommend taking his independent study course. He gives you lesson outlines for the assignments due every other week. He makes it as easy as possible for having to teach yourself. He's lenient on late work. The only negative is it takes him a good week to reply to emails.
243964,3.5,3.0,ECON2103,"May 7th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],Take his independent study course. You don't have to go to class. About every other week there is an assignment due. There are 3 multiple choice tests and are mostly pretty easy. There will be a couple of questions that seem to come out of nowhere but the rest of the test is ok. No cummulative tests. I am taking his Macro independent class next sem
243964,1.0,5.0,ECON2103,"Aug 16th, 2006", No,,,,,[],The class sounds easy but he makes it diffcult with his tests. The assignment do not prepare for his tests. He does not return students emails nor is there a curve in the class. He seems like he does not enjoy teaching and is not very helpful.

It is not a fun class but why would you take Intermediate MicroEcon for fun unless you were Milton Friedman anyway? His tests in all 3000 level courses are 15 pages and you answer 10 in essay graph format of your best knowledge. I made a B and studied very rarely, but after doing all the hw I knew the material pretty well."

He gives out a study guide and if you do each part and review it, that is the closest indication as to what the exam will be like.

Attendance is very important."

Use his review sheets, they tell almost exactly what is on the test. The last question is essay type (a few sentences), and he gets very technical, so make sure you answer every part of it. This class is an easy B, if not A."
244082,3.0,3.0,ECON2203,"Dec 25th, 2006", No,,,,,[],Doesn't seem to be available very much. Gives you a very good review sheet that if you study and know the review sheet pretty well a B is very attainable if not an A. Does use CPS so attendance is a good idea. Tries to simplify things down to point you can understand but sometimes misses. Overall I found him to be pretty good.
244082,5.0,1.0,MACROECON,"Nov 7th, 2006", Yes,,,,,[],He is a very good teacher with very good examples. His tests are exactly like his study guide.

244082,3.0,5.0,MACROECON,"May 9th, 2006",,,,,,[],"Class was so boring. He changed his test style every test, so you didn't know what to expect. When asked a question, he tried to make you look stupid. That's if he knew the answer."

And you absolutely DO NEED THE BOOK for the mc on tests!"
