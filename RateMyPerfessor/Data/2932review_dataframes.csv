479698,4.0,2.0,COMP1,"Aug 14th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"If you go to class and listen, she is more than willing to help!!! She is great...I took her for Comp I and II. She writes helpful hints on your papers too. If you explain yourself to where she understands you, she is more than willing to listen!!!"
479698,2.5,3.0,COMPI,"Jun 7th, 2005",,,,,,[],"Wouldn't recommend her for this class. She is hard to understand in her directions and she doesn't really take the time to explain what it is she's wanting. I made a hard A, if you take her, you'll feel like you had to teach yourself."
479698,5.0,1.0,COMPII,"Nov 18th, 2004",,,,,,[],She got-r-done. Wonderful Dresses like she is in the 80's I love it!

He is very knowledgeable and he also gives you extra tips that are not in the textbook or the handouts. He wants everyone to finish up his class knowing what they need to succeed. Most of the work is done in class with him there to help you when needed.
480555,5.0,1.0,CSYS2073,"Dec 11th, 2019", No, Not Mandatory, A+, Yes, Yes,"['RESPECTED', 'ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS', 'CARING']",Not difficult at all if you just do the work and turn in the assignment. You can basically work at your own pace as long as you submit everything by the end of the semester (but dont wait). I literally never went to class and finished all work within 8 weeks - didn't even have to do the final project. Amazing professor and an easy A.
480555,4.0,1.0,CSCI1203,"May 13th, 2019", No, Not Mandatory, A+, Yes, Yes,"['ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS', 'CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA']","Not difficult if you just do the work and turn in the assignment. Attending the classes is not too enforced, but if you know that you will be needing assistance then it is best you attend class. He email's what you will be working on they day of class along with instructions. Do attend the last few classes of the semester for the final project."

480555,4.0,1.0,CSCI1203,"May 16th, 2016", No, Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],Very easy class. Just show up and do the work. No due dates; just get the work done before the end of the semester. Tons of extra credit. You can do like half the work and make an A.
480555,1.5,1.0,CSCI1203,"Aug 26th, 2014", No,,,,,[],Just saying if you already know about computers then do not take this class in person take it online only. DO NOT take it from Fox because he was all over the place talking about heart transplants etc... What the heck? Stick to Word Excel Powerpoint. He was so off base with his discussions that I dropped the class. He likes to be on stage and talk
480555,5.0,1.0,CSCA1111,"Nov 13th, 2013", No,,,,,[],One of the best instructors I've had.
480555,4.5,2.0,CSYS2073,"Jun 30th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"Wants his students to succeed on ALL their classes. He gives GREAT study hints that you can use for all your classes, and organization skills that will really make your life a LOT easier, if your willing to try them. He will help you in any way he can, and is a really nice guy! I would definitely take him for future classes!!"
480555,4.5,1.0,ENGAS10,"Mar 14th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],You are doing a fine job. Keep up the good work . Thanks you again for help on my MLA paper.
480598,3.0,3.0,PSYCH101,"Nov 5th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"i really enjoyed her class. i learned so much, it was very interesting. ms. butchko is approachable and thorough. the tests were multiple choice when i took her class"
480598,4.5,1.0,PSYCH2023,"Apr 23rd, 2008", No,,,,,[],She gives you plenty of assignments to help you study. Really nice teacher.
480598,3.5,4.0,INTROPSYC,"Aug 16th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"I took the 8 week course, and I really liked it. She was very thorough and used everyday life for examples. Tests were extensive, but she tells you exactly what to study for and goes over the test before giving it out. Do your work and you will get an A."
480598,1.0,4.0,PSYSOC,"Apr 1st, 2006",,,,,,[],I'm don't know about her...she seems to have some issues of her own. I feel like I came away with some really bad education. I do not recomend her.

480598,3.0,4.0,PSY,"Oct 27th, 2005",,,,,,[],"Yeah, she's a nice enough lady but she needs to remember that Intro to psyc is just that....""Intro"". If we were psyc majors, that would be one thing but...we're not. She expects to you to memorize way to much stuff."
480598,5.0,3.0,PSYCHOLOGY,"Dec 10th, 2004",,,,,,[],she likes to talk...gives good reviews for the test....really nice...not a hard class
247927,2.5,1.0,ACCT2223,"Jun 13th, 2013", Yes,,,,,[],"Where to start... Not sure I really learned much in this class as we NEVER took a single test in class. We would be in class max of an hour and half. Do homework in class and thats about it. You basically go home and learn it yourself! Easy EASY A though if you just need the course.. but if you NEED to know the material, do not take!!!"
247927,1.0,3.0,ACC2223,"Apr 26th, 2013", Yes,,,,,[],Horrible do not take. She makes you come to class for no reason. Most of the time you just do homework in class and then she interrupts you every 5 minutes while trying to to your homework. Save yourself take another professor.
247927,1.5,4.0,ACCT1234,"Sep 29th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],You might as well teach yourself?!
247927,4.5,3.0,ACCT2243,"Dec 11th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],Easy A. I took Accounting Information Systems and Payroll Accounting back to back semesters with her. The problems prepare you for real life accounting. You will learn. A lot. If you get something wrong just ask for her help and she will let you correct it for the improved grade. Just take a little pride in your work and you'll get an A no problem.
247927,5.0,3.0,ACCT2223,"Jul 6th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"I really dislike anything to do with math, and accounting fits that category. However, she's a great instructor. There's a quiz every class, but if you do the practice problems you'll do fine on the quizzes, and she drops the 5 worst grades. If you make sure your homework assignments (all online) are all 100% correct, you'll be fine!"
480893,4.0,5.0,PTAANATOMY,"Apr 3rd, 2023", Yes, Mandatory, A, Yes, Yes,"['LECTURE HEAVY', 'TEST HEAVY']","She's very sweet and will answer your questions, but you have to be organized because you will have too many handouts and notes everywhere jumping from one book to the other."
247927,5.0,2.0,ACCT2223,"Apr 27th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],Great teacher who really knows accounting. I even asked for help in one of my income tax classes and she helped clarify a few things for me. Loved her class!
480893,5.0,4.0,PTA101,"Jan 12th, 2017", Yes, Mandatory, A, Yes, Yes,"['GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK', 'RESPECTED', 'INSPIRATIONAL']","She is the best teacher I've ever had! She's clear and goes out of her way to help if you don't understand something, and she never makes you feel like you asked a stupid question!! WONDERFUL!!!"
247927,5.0,3.0,ACCT2213,"Sep 5th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"Great teacher! If you are looking for an easy class that you can blow off this is not it. You will have to work for your grade, but Mrs. Mattson will help you with anything you need help with. I plan to take every class she teaches."
480893,5.0,3.0,PTA210,"Feb 21st, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"This was a great class, I learned more in this class than any other single class. This is a hard class, but Carla Hinkle gives her everything to make you understand, and if you don't, perhaps you should choose another field. I appreciate being treated like an adult, and given the depth of knowledge to match my interest in my career."
247927,2.5,4.0,ACC2213,"Apr 30th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"I hated going to class but if I needed help, she was there for me"

247927,5.0,3.0,ACCT202,"Apr 24th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],Mattson uses a variety of resouces to teach her courses. For those who are willing to use the abundant amount of resources at your diposal the class will not be a problem. I recommend a Study group and asking question whenever you do not understand something. She is always quik to explain it a way that is easy to understand. Do the homework!!!!
480893,3.5,4.0,PTACOURSE,"Oct 27th, 2004",,,,,,[],"If you are accepted into the Physical Therapist Assistant course...you will have her as an instructor. She is a get it right the first time or take it again next year instructor. Her class (grade wise) is ALL test. You screw up on one you are doomed! She will help, yet she cuts no one ANY slack!!"
247927,4.5,2.0,ACC2243,"Dec 13th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],Took her for Payroll Admin. Online. She is GREAT!! Pam is always willing to help you by phone or by email. She explains content well and really knows her stuff!! DO NOT be afraid to take Pam Mattson.
247927,2.5,4.0,ACC2213,"Jun 26th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"I wouldn't say the subject is hard, it's just how she teaches it soo quickly. You really don't have much time to learn the stuff. There is a lot of homework (but in this case it helps). She does drop the lowest test score though. Came out with a B, so it's not horrible, but her teaching style does need some improvement."
247927,3.0,3.0,ACC2213,"Jan 23rd, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"She moves very quickly, but she always makes sure that you understand. Would recommend her."
247927,1.0,5.0,ACC190,"Jan 18th, 2007", No,,,,,[],"I dropped this class because there was ZERO communication. Prof NEVER replied to my emails regarding homework assignments. Syllabus stated to read study guide, could not locate such guide even after I had both a friend and my husband help me. The book is ridiculous! $111 for a book that is NOT EVEN BOUND!!!"
247927,2.0,5.0,FINANCIALACCT,"Jan 6th, 2006",,,,,,[],Only take her if you learn fast and plan on majoring in accounting otherwise find someone else because you will fail!!!!!!!!
247927,4.5,3.0,ACC,"Dec 1st, 2005",,,,,,[],Ms. Mattson is very patient. She will answer your questions and give you a good answer.

247927,5.0,3.0,MNGFINACCT,"Aug 25th, 2005",,,,,,[],"Mrs. Mattson is a great teacher. If you need help get with her outside of class and she will make sure you understand the material. If you try, she will try. Why should she waste her time if you don't want to learn it. Tests can be difficult if you don't do the homework or study. She makes all of the powerpoint presentations available online."
247927,3.0,4.0,FINACCT,"May 5th, 2005",,,,,,[],Very Very help and will go all the way for you but has at a fast pace mode. Her test are like written exams with formulas are easy to remember if you do them for homework. Not good at writting notes on the board though. Good class if your a fast learner.

YOU WON'T PASS."", 'LOTS OF HOMEWORK']","Professor Ketchum actually helped me get through Precalc (which I thought was impossible) He's so willing to work with you, and I don't think I would have done as well if I hadn't taken him. There's a lot of homework, but if you do it--and ask questions--you'll be fine! I took his Essentials+Precalc class, it was phenomenal."
247927,5.0,4.0,MNGFINACCT,"Apr 2nd, 2005",,,,,,[],"Pam is a great teacher. She takes extra time to help those that need the help. Will do anything she can to help you get your grade up. As long as you pay attention in class and do your homework, the tests are not so bad. She has experience in her field and knows her stuff. I highly recommend her!"
18853,1.0,4.0,SPEEC1113,"Nov 19th, 2017", No, Not Mandatory, C, No, Yes,"['TOUGH GRADER', 'LOTS OF HOMEWORK']",Dr. Goodwin was not a good pick. It took her days to e-mail me back when I had a question on a assignment that needed to be answered fairly quickly. I've had to e-mail her many times on correcting grades in the grade book that she had given me zeros for when I know that I had completed the assignment. Very hardcore. Do not recommend her

YOU WON'T PASS."", 'LOTS OF HOMEWORK', 'CARING']","This was my 4th attempt at taking College Algebra/Pre-Calculus after taking it once and dropping it twice. Prof. Ketchum was super helpful at making this my last time. He is sarcastic but if you can't take it then you're just too soft. If you ask for help, he will help. Attendance wasn't mandatory but you will fail if you don't come."
247927,2.0,5.0,ACC2213,"Jan 8th, 2005",, Mandatory, B+,,,[],I wish she would have explained the lesson better in class. Only take her if you have had accounting experience in the past.

He lectures so fast I was not able to even keep up taking notes, he will make mistakes and corrections and stand in front of them while he corrects them. To say he moves fast is an understatement, only take this class if you need no help with precal at all."

My biggest complaint is that her syllabus was all over the place. In order to turn in an assignment, I had to check 4-5 different places in Blackboard to make sure I didn't miss a key element to the assignment. Definitely some busy work each week, which was annoying but I learned some stuff."
247927,5.0,3.0,MNGACCT,"Nov 12th, 2003",,,,,,[],"She knows her stuff, and she is willing to help you if you try. Extra credit and grade your own homework."

I would take this online again any day versus speaking in front of a whole class. There is a lot of connect homework every week but It was easy so you could rack up your points just in case you don't do your speeches well. The syllabus is hard to follow.
247927,1.5,5.0,ACC,"Nov 12th, 2003",,,,,,[],"Pretty tuff class, material is rough. Homework=Easy. Test = VERY DIFFICULT."

481754,5.0,1.0,ECO2023,"Dec 2nd, 2006", Yes,,,,,[],"Great teacher, he provides a list of all assignments at the beginning of the class. He is a good instructor. I took Micro and Macro and he was awesome!!!"
18853,2.0,3.0,COMM2103,"Dec 27th, 2016", Yes, Mandatory, B+, No, Yes,[],"Took as an online 16 week class. The assignments were fairly easy, but the teacher doesn't communicate at all throughout the semester and is rude when you do email her for a question.

481754,1.5,5.0,MACROECONOMICS,"Feb 22nd, 2005",,,,,,[],"I liked him personality wise, but the major assignment has nothing to do with Economics. Also, he gave entirely way too much work for a 3 weekend class. I had to skip another class just to have time to work on his assignments."

18853,2.5,3.0,SPCH1113,"Mar 21st, 2016", Yes, Mandatory, B+,, Yes,[],I took this class for a 16 week course and day one she said that it was a Blended course ( which it wasn't). When it came to the exams she would go over the review in class. Then when you went to take the test and answered the questions how she said to answer them you got the question incorrect and she did nothing to solve the problem. Frustrating
18853,3.0,3.0,SPCH1113,"Dec 7th, 2015", Yes,, A,, Yes,[],It's speech so there aren't many good things to say. 3 speeches don't miss them or you will fail. There is quite a bit of homework involved in this class none of which is really that hard just tedious.

248607,2.5,5.0,PHYS1314,"Dec 13th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"If you don't have lots of time to study then don't take the class. Weekly quiz and only four tests, so you have to do well on them. He makes the test format harder than it needs to be, he enjoys being tricky. Do all the extra credit because you will need it. I liked that he doesn't get bogged down in unnecessary details. Big picture kind of guy."

248607,3.0,5.0,ANATOPHYS,"Dec 10th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],He is a funny guy but hard.So much information to learn in such little time. It's like trying to learn an entirely new language in only a few months. It was only my first class and I feel like i needed a prep class to get ready for his class. It should be the basics and it was every detail of the book
248607,2.0,5.0,BIO1314,"Jan 9th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"Pretty much a jerk,doesn't care if you pass or not,he wouldn't know what was going to be on the practicals till the day of and not very informative for the written, at mid-term most of us studied the wrong material thanks to him.

18853,4.0,2.0,SPEECH2103,"Dec 10th, 2013", Yes, Mandatory, A+,, Yes,[],"I took Interpersonal Communication online. It is a great subject matter and if you are needing an extra 3 credit hours, this is a great class to take. I did all my work for the week in about 2 hours on one day each week. If you will spend about 30 minutes reading the chapter then the computer work is easy. Professor was nice."
248607,3.0,3.0,BIO1323,"Mar 26th, 2005",,,,,,[],"His lecture comes for the book. I am a international student so I could not understand him totally but I got an A on this class. So you can get an A easily if you study for it. It is not easy because of the course itself, not the teacher."
18853,4.0,2.0,SPCH2103,"May 23rd, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"I took the online version of Interpersonal communication, and ended up loving it. At the beginning I was confused by the directions, but once I figured them out the class was fairly simple. There is a test, and an assignment every week, but if you know how to use a textbook then you will do fine. Good professor, very informative, and helpful."
248607,3.5,4.0,HUMANANAT,"Jul 18th, 2004",,,,,,[],Very tough teacher. Nice but expects you to learn on his level. He will help you but be sure to ask him.
18853,2.5,5.0,SPCH2103,"Dec 16th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"This class should have been an easy class. However, the instructor does not stick to the curriculum. There is a ton of added work that does little to further the understanding of the material. It's more of a psychology course than a speech course. She also gives you so much homework you often have no time for any other classes."
484388,3.0,3.0,ORGI101,"Jan 4th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"Hard subject, but she didn't make it any easier. She wants to teach well, but she goes through material too fast. She wants you to be prepared for ORG II, however I don't feel ready."
248607,4.0,4.0,BIO2134,"Dec 28th, 2003",,,,,,[],"Very tough, but worth the effort. I like this class and would reccommend only to serious students. Intimidating at first, but he lightens up as the semester progresses."

484388,2.5,1.0,CHE1114,"Dec 28th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"Slow grading rate, no class outline in terms of curriculum planned, often late at starting class."
18853,4.0,4.0,SPEEC290,"Apr 20th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],I am just finishing up the online course and have learned a lot from it. You watch the video lectures. The examples given there and by Dr. Goodwin made it clear what was expected in the class. The class did require approximately 3 hours a week to view lectures/homework.

Always uses ppt, and puts it on BB. Gives study guide for every test, & tests are basically the study guide. Take him if you need Anatomy. He's great"
402761,4.5,2.0,BIONON,"Nov 4th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],Took his Bio for Non Majors online course and i've really enjoyed it! I'm not a math and science person at all but this class has been easy and I'm passing with a B! Work throughout the week is easy but his midterm/final are hard because they are comprehensive over many chapters so you will need to really study. No quizzes! Take this class!
402761,3.5,3.0,BIO2134,"May 10th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"Very Good teacher very helpful answered all my emails. Gives study guides for exams,which are always helpful. Gives plenty extra credit. The exams can be kinda hard which he uses multiple choice, fill in the blanks, and T or F. Classes are real short I think I only attended 4. Overall He is a good fair teacher"
402761,5.0,4.0,BIO2134,"Apr 25th, 2011", No,,,,,[],Awesome professor! Always helpful and class is very interesting! Very funny and extremely nice. Uses ppt everyday and class doesn't last usually more than 30mins but lots of info that are mentioned. Always willing to stay after class to help with materials that you don't understand. TIP: BUY AND USE INDEX CARDS! they're very handy and helpful :]
402761,2.0,4.0,BIO2134,"Jan 2nd, 2011", No,,,,,[],Did not enjoy this class at all. Took me 30 min. to get to class and his class didn't even last that long....felt like it was pointless for me to even go. Tests were EXTREMELY hard and the info I studied from study guides was hardly on the test. I highly recommend NOT taking this class. Really bad experience.
402761,5.0,1.0,BIOL1383,"Dec 29th, 2010", No,,,,,[],"Very nice man, very easy class. Be sure you show up on test review days. If you can make his class the last one for the day you should, you often get out early. Gives easy extra credit too."
402761,4.5,2.0,BIO2134,"Dec 7th, 2010", No,,,,,[],"I took this 1/2 online, 1/2 in class. The 4 lecture tests are directly from his powerpoints and online notes. The 4 lab test are over materials studied during class time. He's nice and laid back, but you do have to study if you want an A."
402761,5.0,3.0,BIOL2154,"Dec 3rd, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"Took Dr. Juen's honors anatomy, he really wants you to learn the material. He gave 4 lecture tests, 4 lab tests. Show up to labs, and for lecture reviews. other than that, you'll be good. I made an A, but had to do every assignment, and made decent grades on all of the exams."
402761,3.5,1.0,BIOL1114,"Jul 13th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"Had him for Summer Biology Online. Too easy. It was like taking a 5th grade bio course. It was great, though, and a good GPA booster if you're a non-major!"

Wasn't very good about replying to emails but if he needs something from you or feels an assignment is incomplete he communicates very quickly. MidTerm/Final are proctored, but the ch. quizzes are online. The two tests come directly from the quizzes. No extra credit, but I made an A easily without it."
402761,5.0,2.0,BIOL2154,"May 3rd, 2010", No,,,,,[],Awesome Instructor! His tests come from the notes he gives you. Lots of extra bonus points. Left the class with a 98.7% largely due to bonuses. Dr. Juen is HIGHLY recommended. He knows the material and will help as much as it's needed.

Material is hard, but he makes it as easy as possible.

402761,5.0,1.0,BIO2134,"Nov 21st, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],He told us what we need to study for every exam. He does test reviews which are extremely helpful. There are 4 lecture exams and 4 lab exams. He also offers a lot of extra credit(up to 80 points).
402761,2.5,5.0,BIO2134,"Oct 8th, 2009", No,,,,,[],Dr. Juen is a nice man but your grade is based off of 8 test all worth 125 points each. There are no other points. Lab test are all fill in the blank. The lecture test are multiple choice and short answer. So if your not a test taker take someone else.
402761,4.5,1.0,BIO2134,"Apr 22nd, 2009", No,,,,,[],Dr. Juen is a great teacher! I'm taking a half online/half on campus anatomy class. He gives a review for the lecture tests and we go over all the anatomy in class. I've really enjoyed his class and his sense of humor.

Teacher does a great job.Wants students to do well, presents the material well, does pre test reviews, and extra credit.

402761,5.0,1.0,BIO1114,"Sep 29th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],Awesome class. I took online all semester- assignments were clear and simple to do while still learning. He was very prompt about returning emails and helping if needed. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who doesn't want to have to go to a bio class. I actually enjoyed it!!
402761,5.0,3.0,BIO1114,"Aug 12th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"I took the summer intersession General BIO for non-majors class online, and it was great. Everything was clearly outlined, and he was quick at answering emails and was very helpful.

All notes are on BB, and he gives you a test review-make sure you do the test review! And attend ALL labs(you can always go to a different class). He wants you to pass, and gives a ton of opportunities for bonus! He's incredible!"
402761,5.0,1.0,BIONON,"Sep 9th, 2007", No,,,,,[],"Dr. Juen was a great teacher. I had the class as an 8 week internet course over the summer. All you have to do is study the pre-tests and you'll do perfect, I didn't even buy a book and made an A. Excellent teacher."
402761,5.0,2.0,BIO2134,"Jun 5th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],This guy is THE BEST!! I seriously couldn't have asked for a better teacher. He will go over the info a million times if that's what it takes for you to understand. He lets you know everything you need to know for the tests. He also had a good sense of humor. He definitely made taking Anatomy enjoyable! :)

402761,5.0,3.0,BIOFPRMAJORS,"May 20th, 2006",,,,,,[],Great teacher and quite the comedian @ times. Do your practices test and quizes b/c he takes the real test questions straight from there.
253071,1.5,4.0,SOC1113,"Apr 22nd, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],Syllabus might as well be written in Greek. Websites he references are old and outdated. Way tooo many papers to write. Not for the busy full time working adult with children. Praying for at least a C!

You can only take tests & turn assignments in at the Metro campus, real inconvienent when you don't live close, he does allow you to mail it in but its impossible to do the work & mail it in in time. Slow responding to emails."
253071,1.5,4.0,SOCI1113,"Dec 12th, 2011", No,,,,,[],Not a class I recommend taking online for sure. His directions for a lot of assignments were always garbled and incomprehensible and many due dates overlapped/didn't make sense. Book was only used for definitions. Tests were moderately difficult but mostly just deductive reasoning. For an online class I spent a lot of time on campus.
253071,5.0,1.0,SOC1113,"Oct 31st, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"Took his summer online Intro to Soc. class. Very helpful with making sure everyone understands what is due and when. There was a fairly steady amount of work but it was an 8 week class. Exams weren't too bad, and paper assignments were fairly easy. I recommend Dr. W. if you want to be well informed in sociology without being in a social situation."
253071,2.5,5.0,SOCI1113,"May 10th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"This class requires A LOT of work. There are 4 tests, one of which is dropped, and he curves the tests very fairly. As an online class, you are at the school frequently. There are 5 assignments, 4 that are due at the end of the semester. Do not wait until the last minute to do these assignments and study ALL the materials and you should do fine."
253071,4.0,5.0,SOCI1113,"Mar 4th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"assignments have to be turned in at the school but that's no big deal. You can turn in one when you go take your tests and the other 3 have to be turned in tgether so just take those to the school when you go there for your tests. However, if you have a hard time with tests don't take this class...they are hard and he likes to trick u on the answrs"
253071,1.5,3.0,SOC1113,"Nov 14th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"Took as an online,at least I didnt have to actually see his mug everyday. Acted as if I put him out with every email, unclear and unrelated assignments more like an economics class with a personal agenda of his own. I would not recommend him to anyone. He should find a different profession if he hates his students and topic so much."
253071,1.5,4.0,SOCI1113,"Oct 27th, 2010", No,,,,,[],"I LOVE sociology topics, but I really hated this class. The assignments were bizarre and unrelated to sociology topics. As others stated, I had a solid A until the packet of the final 3 papers was graded and got knocked down to a B. I wouldn't recommend his class, it isn't a good online class at all."
253071,1.0,5.0,SOC2013,"Mar 8th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"Terrible instructor. His syllabus is confusing. Boring internet class. I met all the requirements and still received a ""B"" which is ridiculous. Don't TAKE HIS CLASS!"
253071,1.0,5.0,SOC2013,"Feb 26th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"This instructor is ridiculous. His syllabus is seriously about 10 pages. He has you write a ""research"" paper but tells you it's a summary of info you found online-so it really ISN'T a research paper. His instructions are bewildering but when you don't understand or need clarification he is very short as though you're bothering him. I wouldn't sugge"

253071,1.0,5.0,INSOCSOC1,"May 6th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"Avoid this class, very frustrating. Asking for help you won't get him to help you understand the assignment at all. Had an A before the last three assignments were turned in. Made A on first assignment that he graded and the last 3 I made below passing. Didn't even have time to grade our last 3 assignments had another teacher do it."

253071,1.0,5.0,SOC1113,"May 1st, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"Wow, this is the most confusing, ridiculous class I have ever taken. All assignments and tests must be brought to the Metro campus. The assign had to be read multiple times to figure out the meaning. Don't take this class. An A doens't mean anything when you do your last 3 assign. the criteria are so hard and confusing you can still make an D."

First off I wanted to do an online class to avoid having to be at the campus but we take our tests and turn in hard copy papers to the metro campus. His papers have nothing to do with anything! Avoid this class if you can!!
402787,4.0,3.0,MATH0055,"Dec 1st, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"I am horrible at math, and am making a B in his class. He explains everything through with us untill everybody in the class understands.

402787,1.5,4.0,MTH0013,"May 20th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],This guy is terrible! He's a nice guy but when it comes to math he is very confusing and rambles. I dreaded going to his class every day. He is also a part time teacher so if you ever needed help you couldn't find him or get in touch with him. I do not reccomend this guy at all!
253071,3.0,3.0,SOC1113,"Jan 27th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"Took the 8 week online class. 4 assignments and 4 tests, plus you have the option of missing a test or dropping lowest test grade. The tests go by the book and the outlines he provides. Its definitely easy as long as you stay on top of the assignments. I'd definitely recommend if you're looking for a class to fill your schedule!"
402787,5.0,1.0,MATH1013,"Dec 13th, 2006", Yes,,,,,[],Mr. Lindsey is a great teacher. I can't believe his rating on here.

For those who say he can't do math...That's obsurd the man was an engineer for 30+ years...He is a great algebra teacher.
253071,4.0,4.0,PHI1213,"Dec 12th, 2008", No,,,,,[],"Also listed as REL1213. I really enjoyed this class. Instructor is very knowledgeable about Eastern Religions & encourages questions. Most test questions come from the lectures so you cannot miss class.

402787,2.5,4.0,INTERALG,"Apr 8th, 2006",,,,,,[],I am not very good at algebra and he made it even more difficult. I didnt feel that he explained anything very well but he humiliates you in class by calling on you to answer questions when he knows you dont understand it.

The man makes it harder than what an online class needs to be. His syllabus is very hard to understand and don't even think about submitting something in the wrong format or he won't even grade it. Do not take any of this man's classes!
402787,1.5,4.0,MTH1513,"Oct 30th, 2004",,,,,,[],I think he is very nice man but I think he does an ineffective job teaching his class because he does not work examples from the homework he has assigned. He has quizzes at the beginning of each class before he reviews the homework and if you have problems with the homework you flunk the quiz.
253071,2.5,3.0,MARRFAM,"Oct 19th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"Syllabus totally unclear. You have to read it about 10 times before you get it all.

I was sick and running fever on the day specified and didn't feel it would be in my best interest or that of other students going to the testing center. When I notified this professor of that, I was told that if I only had one day that was on me. She would allow me to make up the test but drop me a letter grade. Although I understand the basic point she was making, I felt the calendar marking ONLY that day was deceiving. Apparently you can work ahead on both assignments and tests. My experience with online classes (that is all I have taken up to this semester) is that tests are only available for a certain time.

It goes a long way to just have your stuff in a binder. 3.) Be open minded. Take on unfamiliar etudes!"

Treats everyone like ignorant kids and if you are even one minute late he makes a spectacle out of you. After publicly embarrassing each student by announcing grades (and freaking out on why we didn't make a perfect score)I dropped the class. Wasn't worth it.

266871,3.5,3.0,BIO1383,"Dec 7th, 2006", Yes,,,,,[],This class was dificult even though i had a high B. He usually gives you handouts like notes for you to study. His tests (4ish) are 100 questions mult choice and matching. The final i had was review questions from previous tests. You learn a lot in this class and he's really cool.

266871,2.0,3.0,ANATOMY,"May 7th, 2005",,,,,,[],"Being a Chiropractor, I am sure he knows alot about Anatomy, however, his stories were sometimes inappropriate and he claimed to have cured many.

266871,5.0,4.0,HUMANATOMY,"Apr 6th, 2005",,,,,,[],"He is very smart and definately knows what he's talking about.

He doesn't give much homework because he is lazy and for the same reason he gives the hard generic tests on scan tron so he doesn't have to write or grade anything.

She answers all questions.
270792,2.0,5.0,ACCT2213,"Apr 24th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"Be prepared to teach yourself. She's more concerned with getting through the material than she is making sure her students understand what they are learning, and this wasn't a fastrack course. She also forgets to mention things that you need to know for homework, and for some reason it's not in the book. Taking this class gave me the urge to die."

She insists that you attend every class. If you do not she makes rude comments in front of other students. She cannot keep up with the work. She adds numbers and problems wrong.

410611,4.0,3.0,MICR101,"Dec 30th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],Tool her for micro that was lecture online and lab in person. She knows her stuff and she is very willing to help.

Easy class for working adults with little time. I got a B."
410611,3.5,4.0,BIOL2164,"Dec 7th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],I took her for Micro. She is confusing at times and seems like she has too much going on. But if you come to class & try to catch as much info from her lectures & do the quizzes and study them you will get a good grade. Never expect to get out of lab early. She is very particular about labs so expect to hear a lot of explaining. She knows her stuff

She ask that you write 2-5 pages per take home exam. I wrote 5 pages on all the take home exams and covered the topic plus more. She gave me a so so grade for my opinion.... so, Im obviously not a favorite of her's and it shows. I did not, at all like this class, I do not recommend this class. I dont believe that a teacher should grade a student on anything other than their work and test grades, my grade reflected on Chris having a jealous, personal problem with me... and that is my opinion! If your an attractive female, dont take this class!!"

There is NO other way. This is a difficult class!!!!

166325,4.0,1.0,MATH1513,"Apr 3rd, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"His method of teaching is letting you learn by your own and ask him if you have any problem. Tons of homework. Easy test (if you do your homework you'll be fine). I honestly do not recommend taking his class if you are not good at math, but if you are a quick math learner take his class."

431144,5.0,2.0,HUMANITIESI,"Dec 13th, 2005",,,,,,[],"Very good teacher. He does expect that you read on your own, or else you will be lost in his lectures. Goes directly out of the book. Knows what he is talking about! He likes to tell jokes that arent that funny.. but laugh anyway..."

431670,4.0,2.0,ORGORG,"Dec 13th, 2006", Yes,,,,,[],She's a very nice and leneint teacher. She knows shes not very good with her english so she is extra leneint when it comes to grading. It will be tough at first but if u stick with her u will pass!!! I made a B in her class and all i did was do all the labs (which wasnt hard) and do the take home tests which was easy and show up to class everyday.
431670,4.0,3.0,ORGANICCHEMI,"Dec 15th, 2005",,,,,,[],"She does have a very pronounced accent but you get used to it pretty quickly. She really knows her stuff and is willing to help you in any way.

431670,2.0,5.0,ORGANIC,"May 13th, 2005",,,,,,[],Got in her class--BIG MISTAKE cannot understand a word she says. They should offer her class at 1/2 off b/c it is unfair that she even has a job here.

But attend class and you'll pass
166326,2.5,3.0,HIST1493,"Nov 8th, 2013", No,,,,,[],"""Dr."" Reaves is too young. She thinks she's entertaining, but she's not. You can skip class as much as you want. The study guide is essentially the test. The assignments were never clear, and she grades them ridiculously. I received A's in all my Composition classes, but she gave my papers C's. She left no comments, other than ""develop more"". HATED"

You will take lots of notes, it is hard to keep up, the exams (3) are essay and pick 5 terms to give every detail about. An interview which was very interesting and I learned a lot. No comprehensive final, just what you cover over that time"

166331,3.5,4.0,CHEMISTRY,"Mar 14th, 2003",,,,,,[],She is so far beyond her students mentally that her class might as well be taught in an ancient Greek dialect. She might be more effective if she slowed her pace. Students can't absorb what she wants them to absorb in the time available.
434073,2.5,5.0,GEOL1113,"Jan 8th, 2014", No,,,,,[],I took him for Oceanography. It was a very hard class. The tests were difficult and hard even taking extensive notes. He always answered any questions we had and was a nice guy. The material was just difficult.
434073,4.5,3.0,BIOL1604,"Dec 14th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"Great teacher, knows his stuff! Presentation and anecdotes for lecture. Take notes off presentation and study them. Test questions come from there. Labs are a little hectic. He kind of just leaves you to it. Gives study guides for practical and test essay questions ahead of time. In short he gives you everything you need for an A but you must study"
434073,3.5,4.0,BIO2313,"Aug 10th, 2012", No,,,,,[],"Prin of Ecology. There are no occasional open book tests. The final ended up being open book for our class because we weren't able to cover all of the material thoroughly. He gives a lot of essays and doesn't explain his grades.

I highly recommend his class if you're truly interested in zoology."
434073,3.0,4.0,ZOO101,"Dec 30th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],Took him for zoology and ended up getting a B in the class. Tests are pretty difficult but he is a decent teacher. Labs are super easy but take awhile. If you don't have to take this class don't!

Grades essays very easy, but multi-choice can be misleading at times."
434073,4.0,2.0,ZOO1604,"May 1st, 2010", No,,,,,[],"I loved this class. He is a great teacher as long as you take notes and listen to his lectures.

He loves teaching his subject. You will learn alot!"
434073,4.0,5.0,BIO2136,"Aug 18th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"He was extremely hard but very intellegent. I learned so much in his class. If you hang in there and study your butt off, you will be okay. I had to actually have a study partner which I never have had to have before. You have to dedicate your life to this. You have to know it inside and out for essay questions. You MUST be there 100%!"

That all said, he is very knowledgable on subject and have learned a lot. Glad I'm taking him for the knowledge, but can be uneasy to be around and ask questions. You get use to him by midway semester."

434073,5.0,4.0,MARINEBIO,"May 9th, 2006",,,,,,[],Very interesting teacher. Make sure however that your notes are detailed. You won't survive without these. He always answers straight and goes out of his way to make you feel as much as he does about marine biology.
434073,5.0,2.0,NUTRITION,"Jan 4th, 2006",,,,,,[],"His voice can definitely get boring so take a shorter class if you can, but other than that he's a great teacher. His methods are all laid out for you on day one, and he prepares you for the tests very well. They are some of the easiests tests I have ever taken, the questions are word for word out of the notes. A little studying goes a long way"

Did not really like this course, could have been because I hate reading and did not have time through out the semester to read through the whole entire Intro to Psych book. Gives a lot of homework and one quiz at the end of each that does not relate to the homework that you just spent hours on (if your read). Personally did not like it."
462657,1.5,2.0,CHILDPSY,"Feb 21st, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"Problem I had was she would take forever to respond to an email,that is,if she ever did respond! If she did respond seemed like she didnt read my email and wrote something back that wouldnt really relate or help at all! It also seemed alot of my papers would go ""missing"" Never gave helpfull comments on papers Other then that, pretty easy class"
462657,5.0,1.0,PSY2523,"Dec 15th, 2006", Yes,,,,,[],Took this as online course. Extremely easy. No tests. Wrote one paper per week and answered a discussion board question per week. One large paper due at end of semester. Got an A+. She was helpful and responded quickly to questions via email.

The homework isn't bad and the activities were fun, but the test and quizzes will kill you. You have to know the information inside and out!!

However, her assignments were very unclear and it was nearly impossible to get a hold of her. If you just need this class to pass then I would recommend it.

She still has a practice outside of teaching, so she intertwines real world scenarios with her lectures. Very interesting lectures. Tests can come assigned readings and lecture and are kind of tough. pay attention and try to focus on what she talks about in the readings and you should be fine."

You do have to put the effort in to study and do the assigned readings since your grade is just made up of quizzes and 3 exams.
230765,1.0,5.0,IPSYC1113395,"Dec 11th, 2013", Yes,,,, Yes,[],"Dr. Furlong is not a good professor. What do you call a doctor that graduated with a ""C""? Doctor. This describes her to a T! Exams over multiple chapters will have you pulling your hair out."
230765,5.0,3.0,PSYC1113,"May 16th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],I took Intro to Psyc with her & Human Relations.Dr. Furlong is a great instructor.She lectures very good.Her tests aren't straight from textbook because she wants you to be able to understand her subject and to apply your knowledge to all kinds of situations. If you study and listen to her lecturing you will get an A.
230765,2.0,5.0,PSYCH1113,"May 3rd, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"The busy work is easy points but the tests are very very hard. They are concept questions and not from information in the book. If you are looking for a teacher who goes straight out of the text, do not take her."

462737,1.5,4.0,ECON3023,"Dec 17th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"She isn't that great of a teacher or anything, but I thought she was a nice person. Her class has 10 quizes, which count as one test grade, and like 5 tests with 5 homework assignments. She allows you to drop one test which is good. I can't really complain because I had a 77 and she bumped me up to a B. I liked her."
230765,5.0,3.0,PSYCH1113,"Jan 13th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],This professor is incredible!! She is willing to work with you and really make sure you understand the material. I reccomend her to any student.

462737,2.0,3.0,ECON2013,"Dec 15th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"Hmmm what to say?? If you do decided to take her class be prepaid to spent more time studying than you intend to. I have to say she is NOT as bad as the reviews I have read, however she is late (about 5-10 mins) for almost every class. The only problem with the professor really is she has SOMEWHAT of a hard time explaining things, STUDY on your own"
462737,2.0,5.0,ECON3023,"Dec 14th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"She is a nice lady, but she just speak english very well and her tests are hard and she doesn't help you study for them. If you take econ and want to be interested take Tony, if you want a good teacher then take Jeff, he wrote the book."
230765,5.0,3.0,PSYCH1113,"Dec 14th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"I took the 5 day fast track class. Great teacher, very clear about what to know, plus she has experience in the field. Interesting lectures. Workload can seem overwhelming at first but you can do it if you reallllyyyy study. I bet her full 16 week course would be a great class."
462737,1.0,5.0,ECON2013,"Nov 17th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],She doesn's use BB so you have no idea what your making. She is late every class but frown upon you being late or missing. She talkes way too fast and its hard to understand her sometimes because of her accent. I strongly reccomend you take another teacher on.

462737,1.5,4.0,ECON2023,"May 10th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],Always late until we skipped class to teach her a lesson. She is pretty easy as long as you take good notes and pay attention. She can be very rude as well and doesn't always explain topic well.

462737,2.0,4.0,MACROECON,"Dec 17th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],She is very knowledgeable but she has difficulty explaining the subject in a manner everyone can understand. Some may blame her accent but I understood her fine. She's often late and will hold class as late as she can to makeup for it. If you study the quiz at the end of the chapters you should do fine.

As for all of the bad comments, I am sure those are the people who didn't plan on having to work for a good grade, and just wanted a blow off class."

230765,4.0,3.0,PSYC1113,"Nov 11th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],GREAT teacher. Her lectures are interesting and she posts reviews for each exam.

Also, she gives quizzes that count as extra credit on the exam. Golly, how incredible is that? Her tests are based on lecture. She basically tells you what is on the test during lecture.

232639,3.0,1.0,DEVELOPMENTAL,"Aug 15th, 2005",,,,,,[],"I was really confused in the beginning of her class, make sure you print her notes online. If you just read the chapter you will fail the test.

232647,1.0,5.0,LPN1,"Nov 10th, 2010", No,,,,,[],Awful teacher. Does not care about students. Accuses everyone of cheating. Consistently lies about everything.

232647,4.5,1.0,NURS999,"May 5th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"She gives you a practice test which is almost exactly like the one you will take. If you can work those, you will make an A."

Because she's the only teacher for these courses, I'm considering transferring to another program. I can't believe that she's ""taught a seminar on organization.""

232647,2.0,2.0,NUR2403,"Dec 6th, 2006", No,,,,,[],"Horrible at teaching! If you listen to her you will be completely LOST. This is a learn it yourself class once you figure it out you'll be fine.

Highly recommend him for any math course, especially if you hate math."

234014,5.0,4.0,ELEMSTAT,"Aug 9th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],He did a great job! Explains what you need to know both on a calculator and on paper. Make sure to do the homework on coarse compass. You can stay after class and he'll explain anything you don't understand. He really wants you to get it. Take this guy for stat if you get the chance.
234014,5.0,1.0,MATH2193,"Dec 14th, 2006", Yes,,,,,[],"Lectures are clear and concise, if not the most exciting (it's math, here, folks). If you can go to lecture and take a test, it's an almost guaranteed A."

234190,2.0,4.0,CHE1315,"Nov 16th, 2019", Yes, Mandatory, A, No, Yes,"['TEST HEAVY', 'LECTURE HEAVY']",One of the worst professors Ive had. He gets agitated when students ask him questions about things he thinks are obvious and will embarrass you in front of the class. I got through this class by using khan academy (which he will literally tell you to do if you dont understand something in class instead of explaining) and tutors in the math lab

The labs for this class were not hard at all and we always got out earlier than expected. the math for this course is really hard though.
234190,5.0,4.0,CHEM1415,"Oct 25th, 2018", Yes, Not Mandatory,, Yes, Yes,[],"Extremely nice teacher. Chem2 is a tough subject but if you go to class and study for the tests you will get an A or B. No extra credit but he drops the lowest lab, homework, and he replaces the lowest test grade with the grade from the final (if its higher). I would highly recommend taking his class if you actually want to learn chemistry."
234190,4.0,3.0,CHEM1415,"May 8th, 2015", Yes, Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],He was such a great prof. Exams were tough but we're similar to homework. Drops two Labs and one homework book is needed sometimes but not required. He comes in before class if you want any help. Learned so much. Would take again.
234190,1.5,5.0,OCHEM2145,"Jan 11th, 2013", Yes,,,,,[],I took Milton for general Chem and I enjoyed his class and did very well. When I took him for organic Chem it was a completely different story. Beware! He is a nice man but if you get on his bad side you will pay the price. In addition he was not willing to help answer questions for students who were struggling. I would take somebody else.
234190,1.5,5.0,CHEM1415,"Nov 29th, 2012", No,,,,,[],Do not take this instructor unless you can teach yourself chemistry off of YouTube. He doesn't explain anything he does. He copies his notes onto the whiteboard and that's it. If you dont understand he will tell you to go look it up. Says he gives partial credit for math section of exams but never does. No review for final exam.
234190,5.0,2.0,CHEM1415,"Nov 14th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"He was EXTREMELY helpful. I took this class as an honors class by mistake, had previously attempted to take it as a regular class and had to drop it. I just knew this time would end the same, but he was so helpful that I made it through the class. Not only did I get a passing grade, but I actually understood the material too! Thank you Milton!"
234190,2.5,2.0,CHEM101,"Dec 30th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"Took his class for gen Chem 2 and I ended up with an A. He's not a blow off class though, the tests can be hard if you don't study and really understand the equations. He isn't very helpful and got mad a couple times when people asked what you could tell were stupid questions to him. Labs are pretty easy and we always got out after like an hour to and hour and a half. Gives little extra credit but don't count on that to help much. Overall good Chem class definitely learned what I needed to."
234190,5.0,2.0,CHEM1315,"Nov 16th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"I took Honors Chem 1 with Milton. I had not taken Chemistry before this course though it was not an issue. Milton provides plenty of examples in lecture, study guides and practice problems on Blackboard, and he is available throughout the day for extra assistance if needed.

He will meet with you before or after class, or any other time that will work for you. His class is not a blow off, but if you do the work you can definitely get an A."
234190,4.5,2.0,CHEM1315,"Apr 30th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"Prof King is my favorite teacher to date. Yes, he is strict and chemistry can be hard. This class is definitely not for the cry baby students. Professor King was very clear and very helpful, and offers extra credit. Good class great professor."

234190,5.0,3.0,CHEM202,"Nov 9th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],I took him for chem 1 and 2 and got an A in both classes. He explains concepts clearly and will answer any question or slowdown. He is not supper easy but will help with anything at any time. He gives a study sheet for tests
234190,2.0,5.0,CHEM1415,"Oct 26th, 2009", No,,,,,[],"Mr King is very smart, but very confusing. He will write a formula on the board, then go back and erase parts that he messed up on. He does NOT allow make-up anything. The people who had a year or two of chem in highschool are doing better, but I did not. He send a sign-in sheet around every class period. This is the lowest grade I have ever had."
234190,2.0,5.0,CHEM1315,"Jul 15th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"This was a VERY hard class and I had NO interest what-so-ever! He made it even boring if that is possible. However, his grading style makes it pretty hard to flunk! Lots of wiggle room and even drops a test grade. I struggled with basic concepts and NEVER understood a single thing he taught me, but walked away with a C because of his grading style."
234190,1.0,5.0,CHEM1315,"May 30th, 2009", No,,,,,[],Dont take this class! He doesnt explain the material well at all! He gets frustrated if you ask questions. His tests are impossible and his study guides are useless. Prepare to teach yourself chemistry if you take this class.

234190,3.5,3.0,CHEM1315,"Apr 9th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],Milton is awesome. He is hilarious in class but gets kinda weird one on one. He explains everything clearly but does go kinda fast. Tests are short with a big curve. This is probably the easiest chem class you can take but Chem is not easy!

Mastering Chemistry was an online homework system we used. On lab days, when you are done you leave and you have to turn it in your lab report next lab day. Bonus available. Tests were short too, study!"

234190,4.0,5.0,CHE305,"Dec 1st, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"Explains pretty clear and is available for any questions. Be prepared for really bad jokes, pictures of him, and sarcasism. He was really ok enjoyable, labs are usually able to let out early. Attend class and get extra points are the end of the semester. Study for exams, he usually told us what to really look out for."
234190,1.5,5.0,CHEM1114,"Nov 2nd, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"Do not take this class online, unless you are a genius.

234190,4.5,4.0,CHE1315,"Apr 10th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],love him. he's funny and good at what he does
234190,4.5,4.0,CHE1315,"Jan 7th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],Great Prof. takes alot of intrest in students that want to learn. If you are a student that does not do well on tests he offers enough other work (ie: homework and labs) to offset low test scores. I would reccomend him to any one taking Chem 1.
234190,3.5,1.0,CHEM1315,"Dec 21st, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"**The Truth About Milton King**<br> Milton is a great, nice guy, he can explain chemistry ver well. the only problem I have had with Milton is the inconsistency in his grading. People get different grades for the same answers. I think this can be attributed to his heavy schedule this semester however. Easy tests, lots of xtra credit. take him"
234190,4.5,4.0,CHEM1315,"Aug 25th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"Milton is so helpful!!! Sometimes I was overwhelmed because I'm not the greatest at Chemisty, but he came down to the Math Lab almost everday after class to help students with any problems or questions they had! Great teacher! Highly Recommended if taking Chem 1!!!"

He is more than willing to answer your questions if you ask. He is always in his office during his hours so you can find him if you need to. He gives extra credit for showing up to all lectures."
234190,5.0,1.0,CHE1415,"May 9th, 2006",,,,,,[],"Milton is the best teacher I've had. He spends lots of time for students to understand. He gives review sheets before exams, too. As long as attending the class, it is impossible not to get A at his class."

If i would have taken Chem with anyone else i know i would probaly fail. He is very helpful. His class is not hard but not a slacking class either. Labs with help ur test grade if u dont do good.

I took an 8 week internet course and he allowed us to take 1 full page of test notes in with us to our exams! we just had to turn it in with our name on it at the test center. You have to WANT to fail to do so in his class!"
234204,5.0,5.0,PSYCH1113,"May 12th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],Mr. Hockenbury is a wonderful teacher. The class is quite hard but if you take the practice test and read the book you will pass.

Always returned messages. Very comprehensive. Awesome class."
234204,5.0,4.0,PSYCH203,"Jan 11th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"I recommend doing the practice test online, before reading the chapter, and use it to take notes. Read everything, pictures, graphs, drawings EVERYTHING. Make a page of notes for tests, and take every quiz. If you do that, you can make an A. I only made an A on 1 test, the rest were B's, but b/c of all the points available, I got an A in the class."

As long as you read the chapters given then you will pass. Let's you have a 1 page cheat sheet. If you don't like putting effort into getting a good grade then don't take him. Otherwise, you'll do fine."
234204,4.0,3.0,INTROPSYC,"Oct 28th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],You will need your text book for his class. Very passionate about the subject of psychology.

234960,2.0,5.0,HIST1493,"Jan 10th, 2010", No,,,,,[],The course was ran by Ms. Bellows and Philip Smith. Absolute rubbish. The tests were essays. A list of eight essay topics were handed out prior to the test; four of those essays were on the test. We had to be vetted on all topics according to their outline reviews; which hindered from creative thought and we also had 40 terms (not multiple choic

234960,1.0,5.0,HIST101,"Dec 12th, 2009", No,,,,,[],I was able to pass this class but with no help from her. She wouldn't respond to my emails in a timely manner. When she did respond she would make excuses again stating she doesn't grade the work. It was way too much for someone trying to work fulltime and take another class. Really no need to buy her book though. I passed but it was a struggle.
234960,4.0,3.0,HIST1103,"Oct 6th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],I just finished her online Oklahoma History class. I work fulltime and still managed to get an A in the class. As long as you do the work you will be fine. She answers her emails quickly and will give you any help you might need. Don't let the other posters scare you. Have an open mind and don't get behind on the assignments and you will be fine.

Again, would not recommend."

A lot of STUDYING!!! This should be your ownly class. If your a history major you would benefit, but expect a lot of work to pass the essay test. Your writing a full blown essay in less than 2 hrs-by memory!"

234960,4.5,1.0,HIST101,"Nov 15th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],This was an easy class. She gave powerpoints will all the answers along with the questions she will ask. As long as you read everything she says you will get an A. I got a B simply because I never opened my book.
234960,2.0,5.0,HIS1033,"Sep 23rd, 2008", No,,,,,[],I failed the first test & studied even harder for the second test. I skipped doing homework in my other three classes to study & ended up getting 10 points lower than my first. She wants you to memorize 40 plus terms & then she only gives you 20 to choose from to define on the test. The book is old and doesn't help a lot. I use to love history

Even though I didn't interact a lot with Dr. Bellows, I could tell from the website that she wanted to help students learn -- she had lots of links and powerpoints to make the history more interesting! I definitely spent some time exploring!"
234960,4.5,1.0,HIST1113,"Jul 23rd, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],I do not like history at all and made a very good grade on her internet class. She tells you the definitions along with the essays that will be on the test. Just read the chapter and pay attention to the powerpoint and you will do great!
234960,4.0,3.0,HIST1493,"Jul 16th, 2008", No,,,,,[],"Despite others comments on here, I thought the class was rather easy. It may be a lot of material, but she point blank tells you what will be on the test, and even gives you OUTLINES of the essays she wants you to write. I barely opened my text book all class long and I have a 98 in the class. Your grade depends totally on you"

Her test were glossary terms that had to be memorized and written out, along with two long essay questions. But you do know the terms and she gives you five possible essay questions that will be on the test. Very hard class but it is passable."
234960,4.5,5.0,HIS1493,"Jan 3rd, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"Do not take this as an 8wk course. She gives you a lot of information and expects you to know that information. The tests are hard, but the professors give leeway on the grades. My average was a 79 and they gave me a B. You have to write out the answers for the tests, but she gives you ALL of the information beforehand. Just memorize it."
234960,2.0,5.0,HIST1493,"Nov 19th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],I took an 8 week online course and it was terrible!! There were 60 terms you had to learn the definition word for word. Tests were not multiple choice or fill in the blank you had to write out the definition for the terms plus 2 essays. Too much information to look over and learn before test. Do not take!!!!!

234960,1.0,5.0,HIST113N,"Jul 31st, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],She was very useless as an instructor. I took an internet course through her for ok History. The course was not geared to working adults. She expected you to know 12 glossary terms out of 20 word for word. reading asignments consisted of 5 to 9 chapters at a time. Essay questions in perfect format were expected on test. you were expected to partici
234960,1.5,5.0,HISSECT,"Apr 24th, 2007", No,,,,,[],"Wow... She's a very hard teacher and expects you to write a lot on her tests. They are essay tests and write out definitions (I did online classes, 8 weeks).. I am an A student and I think I'm going to barely pull out of this class with a C. Communication is so-so.. I would NOT recommend this teacher to anyone."
234960,2.0,5.0,HIS1033,"Jan 18th, 2007", No,,,,,[],"Horrible! She gives so much work that you do not have time for any other class. She gives 15 essays and will only ask 2 on the test. She expects you to only work on that class. Plus the material and they way she presents it is boring. Internet class, I had to drop so I would not fail my other classes."
234960,1.5,4.0,HIS1493,"Jan 2nd, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"VERY VERY HARD. There is so much information that you need to know, you need a photographic memory."

Great class with a great professor!"
234960,4.5,3.0,HIS,"Jul 28th, 2006",,,,,,[],"I took an 8 week online class over the summer as a concurrent class. It was my first college class ever and I made an A.

234960,2.5,5.0,HIST1493,"Jun 26th, 2006",,,,,,[],"This class is worse than giving birth, at least you eventually forget the pain from that. I took this during the summer along with ENG comp 1, not a good combination. I made a B, however, I had to put EVERYTHING else on hold including my children. My other grade was not so good because I had no time. Too much to absorb, I agree with everyone else!"
234960,3.5,4.0,HISTORY,"Jun 14th, 2006",,,,,,[],Very hard teacher. She expects to much. If you have a family or life other than history I do not recommend this teacher.

234960,5.0,4.0,HST,"Feb 8th, 2006",,,,,,[],"She is a tough teacher, I took her online course and the tests were mostly essay. But if you study hard you can make an A. It just takes a lot of cramming for tests. You really have to know the subject, she gave excellent study guides that covered everything on the test, so you just needed to know all of it. Not a class for sissies though!"

241456,4.5,2.0,BIOL1224,"Dec 7th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"I have to say, most of the comments left here must have been written by 18 year olds with no perception of reality when it comes to a university or college setting. Many of those in my class were whiners wanting a easy grade. Sure, she was late. Yes, the class was tough. But I never got less than a 90 on an exam; it takes effort. Grow up."
241456,2.0,3.0,BIO4MAJ,"Aug 8th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],"and in that rating from 5-18-07, you think those class population numbers are something to be proud of? Says something about her teaching style, not necessarily the material that must be covered."

241456,1.0,5.0,BIOLOGY,"Jun 1st, 2006",,,,,,[],"She is constantly late plus she goes over the course time frame, tests and quizzes are so hard that no one is meant to get even a C. Started out with 28 people ended up with 3. Didn't get most work back until the end of the semester. Extra credit is a lecture that you have to attend and then write a report about so you might get 7.5 ECredit points"
241456,1.0,5.0,BIOLOGY,"May 8th, 2006",,,,,,[],I think this teacher is great for a different level of students -maybe a university. I don't believe that anyone can be that prepared and if you take this class - take no others -you will not have time

In university you don't get a study guide nor should you have anyone spoon feeding the material to you, you need to know it. I suggest that people spend more time studying and less complaining."

241456,1.0,5.0,BIOLOGY,"Oct 27th, 2004",,,,,,[],"This class is the most difficult introductory class in Biology.

241456,1.0,5.0,BIO1224,"Oct 20th, 2004",,,,,,[],"Does not teach concepts well. Is not teaching as an intro course at all.

241456,1.0,5.0,BIOMAJ,"Apr 15th, 2004",,,,,,[],on average 1/2 to 2/3 drop the class. She is always out of the lab and her tests are very very hard. she also shows movies that you can't understand -language-. I would never go to her again.
241456,4.5,4.0,BIOLOGY,"Apr 6th, 2004",,,,,,[],This class is difficult but she does a good job of presenting the materials and answering questions. The tests are really hard but she offers a lot of extra credit. The people who don't like her class dislike it because they have to work hard!

Tests & quizzes are open book, but timed so you have to know how to find the material quickly & have some understanding of the material covered. She also grades on a curve & has 2 bonus opportunities."
242666,2.0,4.0,PSYC1113,"Dec 14th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"I took this class online and that's why I put attendance not mandantory. This class is very very hard. I made A's in my other 3 classes & a D in this class, so I must retake. Teacher is not very leaneant. She's kinda stern.

If she dislikes you, she will find every possible way to sabotage you and get you kicked out. Before nursing school, i have made the honor roll & have always gotten along with instructors. I have spent this entire semester fighting, because she constantly wanted to start trouble with me. BEWARE!"
244325,1.0,4.0,NURS2213,"May 10th, 2017", Yes, Mandatory, A, No, Yes,[],The second worst professor I have had in the nursing program. Unfortunately she is not here to help students succeed. She is very condescending and short with her answers to questions. She is on a power trip and does everything she can to put students and fellow teachers in their place which is beneath her. Very discriminating to male students.
244325,5.0,2.0,LEVEL2,"Dec 30th, 2013", Yes,,,,,[],I was lucky to have her as a teacher in level 1 and level 2! She is very helpful and finds experiences for you to do in clinical. Encourages you to ask questions. I learned a lot!

244325,1.5,5.0,NURS1,"Jun 11th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"Had her as my Level 1 Clinical instructor. She is very picky, plays favorites. She is nice to your face but if she does not care for you for whatever reason be prepared for her to find a reason to kick you out. I did all the work, and studying. Act's as if she care's, and understands, it's all a front. I am in a new RN program now and so happy."
244325,4.5,5.0,NURSLVL1,"Jan 5th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],Has the hardest content by far on the exams. Make sure you know her lectures in and out. A good instructor but wasn't very nice toward the end of the semester. She was very accusing of a couple people the last month or so.
244325,5.0,2.0,NUR1431,"Jul 13th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],Had her for level 1. She is very informative and moves really quick. She tells you exactly what she expects just pay attention when she repeats something. She teaches you how to start thinking like a nurse.
244325,4.5,4.0,NURS1447,"Apr 26th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],One of the best in Level 1. You don't get a choice for teachers in this program. Be glad she is one of them.

If I had to take level one again, This is definitaly the instructor to have. Don't believe the other bs this other person is talking about. He obviously failed and is blaming her for his crappy work. I made an A, and she is part of the reason."
244325,5.0,2.0,NURSING,"Aug 18th, 2005",,,,,,[],Linda was GREAT! Very helpful and understanding. Not hostile towards men or women. Teaches in a fun way. The best teacher I had in level 1.
