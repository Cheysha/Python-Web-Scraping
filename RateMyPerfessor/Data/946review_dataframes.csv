She is a dedicated to you actually learning and not merely passing with a good grade (although that's her desire, is for learning + good grade). She appreciates quality writing and will correct sloppy writing."

She is a harsh grader and has zero tolerance for shenanigans. If you're there all the time and always do what she shows you, you'll ace this class, no problem, even if you're not into computer programming. But, if you're absent or slack off a lot..."

Just do the work and you'll be fine. Make an A on all speeches you'll will have an A in the class. He is very clear on his expectations, and grading criteria. You don't have to get the book to pass the class. I didn't use mine, and just wrote notes while he lectured. Each to your own on that one."
132940,3.5,2.0,COMSC1433,"Apr 22nd, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"I had her in VB Programming. She is one of the tougher teachers here, but she is also faily easy. If you don't understand something, TELL HER! She is extremely helpful and is willing to work with anybody. Attendence isn't mandatory, but it is tough to catch back up if you miss. You also get bonus points on your final if you don't miss a day."

He creates a very welcoming class environment and it's pretty easy to get great grades on your speeches. His criteria for grading is very clear. If you do all the assignments it's very easy to get a really good grade.
132940,2.0,2.0,COMSC1033,"Jan 29th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"Very rude. Her in class presentations are pointless, as stated before she reads right out of the book but with less detail and at a slow pace. She takes off points for minor mistakes. She suggested i did not know how to use desire to learn when it is a very simple program. I dont not recomend by any means"
132940,2.5,2.0,COMSC1033,"Dec 6th, 2007", No,,,,,[],"didn't like how the class was thought, learned everything I needed from the book. Her lectures were from the book, but in less detail and didn't explain as much and she asks questions ""how do we open this project?"" that are just meaningless and slow class down.

If you have to take Public Speaking, TAKE STRICKLER!!!! I loved his class and him. Talking in front of people can be scary, but he made it easier. You will have to take notes, but he rarely teaches all the way to the bell. Amazing class because of the professor."
132940,4.0,4.0,SEVERAL,"Jul 9th, 2005",, Mandatory, D-,,,[],"Pretty good teacher. She does grade assignments anally. Such as taking off an entire point for forgeting to put a file name in code (so if i turn in the assignment with just the file name I get a 1/10?). No you don't, but seriously, she is a pretty comp sci teacher. I would take her again. Twice."

He is incredibly clear in his lectures and in what he wants from your speeches. He had us buy the textbook but I never used it. His lectures and quizlet will give you everything you need for the midterm and final. He is very fair and understanding in his grading. He wants the best for his students.

HER LECTURES MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT, BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO DECIDE WHAT IS IMPORTANT AND WHAT ISNT. I NEVER KNOW WHAT TO TAKE NOTES ON, AND YOU CANT REALLY FOLLOW HER IN ANY KIND OF ORGANIZED WAY TO TAKE NOTES. THE ENTIRE TEST COMES FROM THE BOOK."

A lot of people seem to do well in his class, but if you have a hard time paying attention, I wouldn't recommend. He's rather boring, but he is very lenient and reasonable.

1937691,2.5,4.0,GENCHEM1,"Nov 6th, 2014", No,,,, Yes,[],She doesn't use the time you have in her class wisely. Instead of working out problems and teaching us the material we need for our exam and quizzes she likes to talk about vocab and things that don't matter. She puts stuff on the test and quiz that we've never gone over. She assumes you know more than you do. She holds you late quite often.

Granted, I hated all the stuff we were reading, but it was hard to follow her explanations of the subject matter. She kinda flies around on what she's talking about, and it takes her awhile to get to the original subject. But she is a very nice woman."

Do not turn in assignments late; she hammers you for that. Doing so is probably going to cost me a letter grade. Also very picky about significant figures. She'll hammer you for that, too.
