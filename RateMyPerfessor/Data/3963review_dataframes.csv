80900,2.0,4.0,CS2033,"Jan 9th, 2022", Yes, Not Mandatory, A, No, Yes,['LECTURE HEAVY'],Hard to really learn in class with the minimal lack of examples. In-office hours he is great and will work as many examples as you need. The programming assignments were vague and very frustrating because of his auto grader.
80900,2.0,4.0,CS2033,"Jan 8th, 2022", Yes, Mandatory, A, No, Yes,['RESPECTED'],Dr. Hale had too many other things going on to teach this class effectively when I took it. The textbook was helpful. He used a faulty autograder. Had to email him to reclaim points after most homework assignments. At least he extended a lot of deadlines. Often missed appointments with students. I've heard he is better for upper level classes.
1067108,2.0,1.0,MUS2092,"May 16th, 2016", Yes, Mandatory, A+,, Yes,[],"Easiest diction class. If you are sensible, don't bother with this class. One week per language means no retention. Brady is an awesome person and is incredibly kind and caring about his students, but this class is not a good use of your time. Shame on TU for not taking their diction courses more seriously!"
80900,5.0,3.0,CS2033,"Apr 5th, 2017", Yes,, A, Yes, Yes,['CARING'],"Great lecturer, learned a lot. Uses the whiteboard. Light workload. Take notes and study and you'll do fine. Very friendly and open. Also did research for this professor."
1067108,5.0,3.0,VOICE,"May 11th, 2014", No, Mandatory, A,,,[],"Brady McElligott is the best professor I have ever had! He is caring, and even willing to help in your other classes if you need it! He is the most talented professor in the music school, and should be considered a music genius. I wish he taught every class."
1788881,5.0,3.0,FIN3003,"Dec 9th, 2016", Yes, Mandatory, A, Yes, Yes,"[""SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS."", 'ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS']",Awesome teacher! Pleasant dude to chat with. Always glad to help students. The material seems difficult but a quick visit to his office will make it black and white. Attending class is a must!! A laptop for notes is the key to getting an A. His tests are STRAIGHT from lectures so pay attention. He teaches better than the book but it's still needed.
80900,4.5,3.0,CS2033,"Jan 11th, 2015", Yes, Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],"Great professor. Makes class and expectations very clear. If you see him during his office hours, he is extremely helpful. If you talk with him, he's flexible on assignment deadlines, project grades, etc. He just wants you to learn and understand the material."
80900,1.5,1.0,ESMGRAD,"Oct 1st, 2009", No,,,,,[],"Outsourced part of his teaching to some PHD students in what turned into an EXTREMELY disorganized, ill-explained project. We were supposed to complete an assignment on a wiki which was inaccessible almost the entire week we had to complete the assignment. Emails sent to the class were not sent to everyone"
1067108,4.0,2.0,MUS2092,"Oct 1st, 2013", Yes, Mandatory, Not_Sure_Yet,,,[],"Brady is an excellent teacher. In Diction class, he is engaging and very intelligent. The work load is light, but you're still learning the material. When asked questions, he's straightforward and helpful."
1788881,5.0,3.0,3003,"May 12th, 2015", Yes, Mandatory, B-,, Yes,[],Really knows his stuff! Must attend class to do well on exams. He makes lectures interesting and I really enjoyed his class. Exam reviews are helpful and you must put in study effort to receive a B or higher. Very willing to help outside of class. Class project was a little tough but still manged a B overall. Would definitely take again!
80900,3.5,3.0,CS2033,"Mar 23rd, 2006",,,,,,[],"Did a good job of keeping the class interested and awake during the boring sections of the course and slow days. In the (infrequent) homework assignments there were often questions about material not covered in class, but he prepares you well for exams . I never went to him for help so I'm not sure how helpful he is outside the classroom."
1788881,4.0,4.0,3003,"Nov 4th, 2014", Yes,,,, Yes,[],He has good stories to tell during lecture. Assignments and exams are not easy and at the end of the semester you must complete a project that's not easy at all.
1067108,5.0,4.0,MUSC6701,"Nov 7th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"Dr. McElligot is the best professor and mentor in them music department at The University of Tulsa. Always having a consistent positive attitude, Brady inspires music students to be the best that they can be."
80900,5.0,2.0,ANY,"Sep 29th, 2005",,,,,,[],"Great professor, great sense of humor. Very willing to help if you have problems. The project in E-comm is a lot of fun."
1788881,4.5,3.0,FIN3003,"Jan 13th, 2014", Yes,,,,,[],"Extremely helpful in and out of class; just attend class and pay attention. The exams come literally from class lectures and examples. If he's working on a problem on the board, it will be on the exam."
1067108,4.5,2.0,MUS150L,"Jul 23rd, 2007", No,,,,,[],"Great instructor, cares about students."
80900,2.0,4.0,CS2033,"Aug 24th, 2005",,,,,,[],I told him that I was nervious about an up coming test. He responded that I shouldn't worry because there will be more tests(2 more total). That I should go ask the TA any questions concerning the material.
1067108,5.0,2.0,MUS250L,"Oct 28th, 2006", No,,,,,[],"Oct 28th, 2006"

80900,2.5,3.0,ESM,"May 2nd, 2004",,,,,,[],At least he tries.
80900,4.5,2.0,CS2033,"Mar 22nd, 2004",,,,,,[],"Stuck closely to the text, Exams were material that was expected, Overall a great prof"
80900,4.0,1.0,ECOM,"Dec 17th, 2003",,,,,,[],"This class was the most boring class I've taken at TU, but I easilly got an A."
80900,4.0,2.0,ECOMM,"Dec 6th, 2003",,,,,,[],"Clear, concise, and a sense of humor. Fair, unbiased and just an overall good person. Doesn't mean you won't have to know your stuff but his test are fair and he will work with you if you need to pull up your grade. Take his classes."
1083371,3.0,1.0,DEANSSEM,"Dec 2nd, 2011", No,,,,,[],"The Dean's Seminar is pretty much a blow off class as long as you show up and turn stuff in when you are supposed to. If you miss class, you have to watch a video and write a paper. I'm amused by the reviews about her 'hotness' because she looks exactly like a female Martin Short. Seriously. Picture Martin Short with long dark hair. Google it."
439875,5.0,3.0,SOC1013,"Apr 18th, 2019", Yes,, A, Yes, Yes,"['PARTICIPATION MATTERS', ""SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS."", 'TEST HEAVY']","Assigned readings for each class out of the two textbooks, which were phenomenal and always interesting and relevant to the lectures/discussions. She's intimidating, especially at first, but AMAZING. She wants students to really learn the material and how it relates to real life. Get in her good graces by doing the readings beforehand."
1083371,4.5,4.0,THSS3L,"Mar 9th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"I had her for my 3L paper class. She was great. And hot. 10 years later, she still looks good."
439875,3.0,4.0,SOC1013,"Jun 2nd, 2018", Yes, Mandatory, B, No, Yes,"['TOUGH GRADER', 'GET READY TO READ', 'PARTICIPATION MATTERS']","She seemed to take very basic social issues and concepts and make them too complicated or confusing. This class needed more than a lot of studying and knowing the material - it also involved luck and kissing up. She was good at finding some flaw in our answers. Decent teacher, just made a simple subject unnecessary hard"
1083371,4.0,5.0,CONT101,"Feb 22nd, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],Great Professor.
1083371,4.5,4.0,KS3,"Dec 27th, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],Very enthusiastic...helpful...knows her stuff. And she is absolutely gorgeuous to top it off.

439875,4.0,4.0,SOC3093,"Oct 19th, 2016", Yes,,, Yes, Yes,"['RESPECTED', 'GET READY TO READ', 'PARTICIPATION MATTERS']","Blocker is the bomb, but if sociology isn't your thing, don't take her class. Expects a lot from her students, but cares a lot too"
439875,5.0,2.0,SOC1003,"Apr 18th, 2016", Yes, Mandatory, A+,, Yes,[],"By far the best professor I have had on this campus so far. She is a joy to be around and an excellent teacher that teaches beyond the words on the page. I just had her for the introductory sociology class (Sociological Imagination), but I'm looking forward to taking more classes with her. Tests are easy if you put in minimal effort."
439875,5.0,1.0,AS1001,"Aug 26th, 2015", No, Mandatory, A+,,,[],"I just had her for an intro class and I was undecided so it was called ""Doing College."" It was a joke class, but she was hilarious. She is super sarcastic and makes fun of everyone (in a joking way) and you just have to laugh. She was also my advisor & was so helpful & REALLY cared about me & how I was doing. Most interesting person I've ever met."
439875,4.0,3.0,INTRO1033,"Dec 8th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"interesting lectures, but tests can be pretty tough for a 1000 level block course. just make sure you come to class and do the readings, doesn't hurt to participate a lot to suck up. not a bad class."
1795368,5.0,3.0,ASL0000,"Jan 29th, 2013", Yes,,,,,[],Best and Deaf professor. Love her!!
439875,4.5,5.0,SOC1013,"Feb 9th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"Awesome teacher! Keeps it interesting and fun, do not take this if you have thin skin, she loves to weed out people if they can't handle it. Her tests are hard as heck, they are not things you can memorize, you have to apply the knowledge. I look forward to her classes in the future."
1085618,5.0,2.0,MIS2013,"Mar 28th, 2011", No,,,,,[],Prof. Crawf is amazing! He definitely enjoys what he does and really cares about his students. I have him for an 8AM Programming class and he always has a smile and a great outlook - I really love starting my day with his class. He is straightforward and makes sure everyone understands the information even if you have never experienced it before.
439875,3.0,3.0,SOC1003,"Nov 2nd, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],I heart this woman. Best professor ever and best advisor ever. Her classes are always so intelligent and delightful. TAKE HER or you will regret you never did.
1085618,5.0,4.0,MIS4033,"Mar 23rd, 2009", No,,,,,[],"He is an amazing professor and his classes have been some of my favorites so far. He's fun and interesting and the classwork is fairly easy if you just pay attention in class. Attendance isn't really mandatory, but you'll miss important things if you skip class."
439875,5.0,4.0,SOC1003,"Feb 12th, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],"She's the funniest nicest professor I've had thus far. Willing to help any way that she can, will happily answer any questions you have, You can tell she loves teaching, and yes she does have favorites, but all you really have to do is contribute to discussions. Tests are kind of hard. You have to master the art of application, not memorization"
1085618,5.0,1.0,MIS3003,"Jan 2nd, 2008", No,,,,,[],He was an outstanding professor. MIS was a subject completely foreign to me and I did very well in his class. He explains the material and actually makes it interesting. He was a generous grader and made sure all test material was thoroughly covered before test time. FYI- I rarely used my textbook. I highly recommend him!!
439875,4.5,3.0,SOC3003,"Feb 2nd, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"If you want a freaky ride into the scary reality of human existence, then she will take you there. She kind of makes me regret having become a business major and not a sociology major."
439875,5.0,4.0,SOC3143,"Mar 21st, 2007", Yes,,,,,[],One of my favorite professors at TU. She encourages critical thinking and creativity in the classroom more than most profs. The material is interesting so the papers and essays are not hard to complete.
439875,5.0,2.0,SOC1033,"Dec 13th, 2005",,,,,,[],"Awesome professor. She was always very clear and answered any questions we had. Her tests were not terrible, even though she will tell you they are. However, they will make you think! If you read, pay attention in class, and ask for help if you need it (because she will help you!), you should do quite well."

439875,5.0,4.0,SOC1033,"Jul 31st, 2004",,,,,,[],"Great Professor. She will go out of her way to help you, all you have to do is ask. Tests are hard but not impossible--some students have to work harder than others. She is open minded and has a great sense of humor."

There are only 3 tests over three books. No homework. I barely went to class and i didn't read any of the books and I got an A, I WANTED to go to class its just that I was too tired at 9am!"

Go online and find the online version where you can hit Ctrl F and find the key words. You won't even have to read any of the three assigned books because he gives a study guide a week before the test with everything you need to know.
1804910,2.5,5.0,2053,"Jul 1st, 2015", No, Not Mandatory, C,, Yes,[],"Very nice guy, but I would avoid his class at all costs. His lectures lead you to believe that the exams will be simple due to the easy example problems he does, but the exam QUESTIONS ARE NOTHING LIKE THE LECTURE EXAMPLES. The class average was a 60 and he did not curve. Class was my only C is college."
80909,3.5,2.0,ECON2013,"Jan 6th, 2016", Yes, Not Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],Dr. Dugger is definitely one of the most interesting teachers I have ever had. He is very enthusiastic about economics and tries to keep the class interesting with stories. Grade consists of three exams based on three books and class lectures. Would probably take class again.
1106622,5.0,3.0,ES3003,"Jan 12th, 2018", Yes, Not Mandatory, A+, Yes, Yes,['GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK'],"Edwards works for the CFD company and, therefore, is knowledgeable about the topic overall. Warning: the first test topic might suck for those who hates statics, but other than that it is one of the best classes you can take. Also, he answers ALL of your questions. The homework is hard, but it prepares you for the tests really well."

That being said, his tests are nothing like his lectures. His questions are far too advanced for the class. Class average was a 65% and he doesn't curve. I strongly suggest you avoid him unless you want your GPA to take a hit."
80909,4.0,2.0,ECON2013,"Dec 12th, 2012", Yes,,,,,[],"He is a really funny guy, helps to make class interesting. The tests can be tricky if you haven't read the book or missed class. Making sure you stay on top of the readings and taking notes! I would take another class with him."

He gives lots of practice problems and will go completely out of his way to teach his students. He was at the university helping me study multiple times past midnight. The best advice I can give for his class is always ask questions and don't be afraid to ask for help. He works full time so sometimes he gives tests back late.
453599,1.5,4.0,FIN3083,"Mar 3rd, 2006",,,,,,[],Wow...how he ever got a teaching position at TU I don't know. I wouldn't trust him with any of my finances. Wouldn't take Byers if you are actually interested in Finance and want to learn something. He teaches from the books powerpoints and uses the bought answer solution manual.
80909,3.0,5.0,ECONALL,"Oct 13th, 2011", Yes,,,,,[],"People always say this professor is the easiest, take him, take him. But I think he has caught on everyone's little game. His tests are hard, multiple choice is very confusing. He uses these textbooks that he refers to the ""anti"" of what he teaches. Funny, friendly and helpful yet confusing, lost and underestimated by students."
453599,2.0,4.0,FIN3003,"Dec 15th, 2004",,,,,,[],A pompus prick. Thought of himself as finance god and put things on tests that he never went over.
1804910,5.0,4.0,2053,"Jan 26th, 2015", Yes, Mandatory, A,, Yes,[],I find Dr. Centauri really frustrating. Here I am trying to study the things I find totally awesome and worthwhile and he has to go and make physics interesting and accessible. Quit f*cking up my plans and let me keep pretending that physics is just a graduation requirement and not yet another subject I wish I had a lifetime to explore.
80909,2.0,2.0,ECON101,"Sep 25th, 2010", Yes,,,,,[],"His cynical humor is funny, but he speaks with authority with a jaded view of economics, particularly Capitalism. What I learned from him was the opposite of what I should have learned, then had to unlearn. Avoid."

First test was a piece of cake but second test was literally nothing like study guide. Won't ever use textbook and don't expect the study guide (if given) to be anything like the test. Took him a month to grade one test. Gives tons of partial credit but doesn't make up for the insane questions he asks.

80909,3.0,2.0,MACROECON,"Oct 31st, 2009", Yes,,,,,[],He tries to make econ fun. Tells stories about Jack Daniels and Sex. Curses. Stories often make class longer. Tends to also keep you a few minutes late. Tells you exactly what to study. Be at every class or have someone take notes for you. Kind of funny.

This sad excuse for an econ teacher doesn't care about his job because he has tenure and he won't deny it. EVIL"
1804910,1.0,5.0,PHYS2063,"Aug 3rd, 2014", Yes,,,,,[],"This professor is one of the worst I've had at TU. Has unclear expectations, scattered lecturing, and absolutely no idea what's going on. He curves everything arbitrarily so you never know what your grade is. He will tell you you're doing fine, and then fail you-it happened to me. His homework is awful, and I'm a hard worker. Save yourself."

He is a good teacher and teaches you what you need to know to solve problems. You will learn a lot and this class is not super time consuming. His homework actually helps you learn unlike mccoys.

80909,4.0,1.0,ECON3023,"May 11th, 2004",,,,,,[],"Okay, I didnt buy the book, I studied for a total of 4 hours the entire semester and made an A. He cracks jokes which can be good and can be bad. He rambles about donuts but wierd enough, i learnt a lot."
1106622,3.5,2.0,PHYS2053,"Apr 11th, 2008", Yes,,,,,[],"He's definitely easier than McCoy, especially his exams. As long as you work the old tests (McCoy's), you will definitely have an edge. Homework is probably the hardest part of the course. Attendance is 5% of the grade (to solve borderline issues), but turnout is still usually low (maybe because it's 8am). He's a nice guy and grades very fairly."
